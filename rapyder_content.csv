Example in Action: Companies employing Amazon CloudWatch experience up to 95% fewer critical incidents, thanks to real-time performance tracking and alerting systems. Partner with a proactive MSP that guarantees redundancy, failovers, and business continuity, and be certain. 7. Flexibility with Vendor-Agnostic Strategies Worried about vendor lock-in? You should be. Vendor exclusivity stifles innovation and increases dependency. Adopting containerization tools and serverless architecture will be critical in the coming years. These strategies allow unparalleled flexibility, enabling businesses to migrate workloads without restrictions. Pro-tip? Ask your MSP about their approach to aligning cloud strategies with long-term business goals. An MSP with a “vendor-agnostic” mindset can help you avoid contract-related headaches down the road. Taking Action Today for Success in 2025 The future of cloud-managed services holds incredible promise. Smarter systems, seamless integration, and businesses running with unprecedented agility. However, these benefits come with their own set of challenges. Navigating cost optimization, adopting advanced AI, and securing data responsibly all require expert guidance. This is where we come in.

blog,Hybrid Cloud vs. Multi-Cloud Strategy,"Hybrid Cloud vs. Multi-Cloud Strategy Sachin Khed March 3, 2025 Home >> Insights >> Blog >> Hybrid Cloud vs. Multi-Cloud Strategy In today’s fast-paced digital landscape, organizations must be agile, resilient, and scalable to stay competitive. As cloud adoption accelerates, businesses are increasingly turning to Hybrid-Cloud and Multi-Cloud strategies to optimize performance, enhance security, and ensure business continuity. But how do organizations decide which strategy best suits their needs? And how can they effectively implement and manage these complex cloud architectures? This blog explores about hybrid and multi-cloud strategies, key differences, common features, and strategic benefits of these deployments—helping businesses make informed decisions to maximize agility, optimize costs, and drive innovation. What is Hybrid-cloud Strategy? A hybrid-cloud strategy is an approach that combines on-premises infrastructure, private cloud, and public cloud services to create a flexible and scalable IT environment. This strategy allows organizations to leverage the best of both worlds—control and security of private infrastructure with the scalability and cost-effectiveness of public cloud—while optimizing workloads based on business needs. Why Do Organizations Use a Hybrid-Cloud Strategy? Flexibility & Scalability – Organizations can scale workloads dynamically between on-premises and cloud environments to handle demand fluctuations. Cost Optimization – Critical or sensitive workloads can remain on-premises, while less sensitive operations leverage the cost efficiency of the public cloud. Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery – Hybrid cloud ensures redundancy and resilience, minimizing downtime in case of failures. Compliance & Security – Companies in regulated industries (e.g., healthcare, finance) can keep sensitive data in private environments while using the cloud for non-sensitive workloads. Optimized Performance – Workloads can be strategically placed based on performance requirements, ensuring low latency and high efficiency. Innovation & Agility – Organizations can modernize applications using cloud-native services while maintaining legacy systems on-premises, enabling a smoother digital transformation. A hybrid-cloud strategy empowers businesses with greater control, security, and agility, making it a preferred choice for organizations seeking a balanced and future-ready IT infrastructure. What is Multi-Cloud Strategy? A multi-cloud strategy involves using services from multiple cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure) to avoid dependency on a single vendor and optimize performance, cost, and reliability. Unlike hybrid cloud, which integrates on-premises and cloud environments, multi-cloud focuses on leveraging multiple public and/or private cloud platforms to meet specific business needs. Why Do Organizations Use a Multi-Cloud Strategy? Avoid Vendor Lock-In – Organizations can prevent reliance on a single cloud provider, maintaining flexibility and negotiating better pricing. Optimized Performance – Workloads can be distributed across different cloud providers to leverage regional availability, latency, and specialized services. Enhanced Resilience & Redundancy – Using multiple clouds ensures higher availability, disaster recovery, and risk mitigation in case of provider outages. Cost Efficiency – Companies can choose cost-effective services from different providers, optimizing cloud spending. Regulatory Compliance – Businesses operating in multiple geographies can store and process data in region-specific clouds to comply with legal and industry regulations. Access to Best-in-Class Services – Each cloud provider offers unique strengths (e.g., AWS for scalability, Azure for enterprise integration), enabling businesses to use the best tools for their specific needs. By adopting a multi-cloud strategy, organizations gain greater flexibility, resilience, and cost control, allowing them to align cloud resources with their business and operational goals. Hybrid-cloud Vs Multi-cloud: What are the key differences? Let’s look into some the key differences between these two cloud deployment models: Hybrid-cloud Vs Multi-cloud: Common Features Despite their differences, hybrid-cloud and multi-cloud strategies share several common features that help organizations achieve flexibility, scalability, and resilience. While hybrid-cloud focuses on integrating on-premises and cloud resources, multi-cloud emphasizes the use of multiple cloud providers—but both strategies aim to enhance agility, security, and operational efficiency. Can Hybrid-cloud be a multi-cloud? Yes, a hybrid-cloud can be a multi-cloud, but not all multi-cloud environments are hybrid-clouds. A hybrid cloud solution can incorporate a multi-cloud within its deployment. The key distinction is that while both hybrid and multi-cloud strategies utilize public clouds, only hybrid cloud includes a private cloud. This means a hybrid cloud environment can qualify as a multi-cloud if it integrates two or more public cloud providers. However, a multi-cloud cannot be classified as a hybrid cloud unless it also includes a private cloud component. Example of a Hybrid Multi-Cloud A company hosts sensitive data on-premises for security compliance. It uses AWS for scalable computing power and Azure Cloud for AI/ML workloads. It leverages a private cloud for internal applications. This setup combines on-premises infrastructure + multiple cloud providers, making it both hybrid-cloud and multi-cloud. Choosing Between Hybrid-Cloud and Multi-Cloud for Your Organization Selecting the right cloud strategy depends on your organization’s business goals, security needs, compliance requirements, and IT infrastructure. Here’s a guideline to help determine whether Hybrid-Cloud or Multi-Cloud is the right fit for your business. Choose Hybrid-Cloud If: You need on-premises infrastructure – Critical workloads require private cloud or on-premises data centers for security and control. Compliance and security are top priorities – Industries like healthcare, finance, or government must keep sensitive data in private environments. You want to modernize gradually – Hybrid-cloud allows a phased migration to the cloud while maintaining legacy systems. You require low-latency processing – On-premises or private cloud resources help in latency-sensitive applications (e.g., edge computing, manufacturing). Choose Multi-Cloud If: You want to avoid vendor lock-in – Spreading workloads across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure) ensures flexibility. You need best-in-class services – Different cloud providers offer unique strengths (e.g., AWS for compute, Azure for enterprise integration). Your business operates in multiple regions – Multi-cloud enables compliance with local data regulations by choosing providers with regional presence. You prioritize resilience and uptime – Using multiple clouds ensures redundancy, reducing downtime risks from provider outages. You aim for cost optimization – Choosing services from different providers allows cost-effective resource allocation. When to Combine Both? A Hybrid Multi-Cloud approach can be the best solution when businesses need both on-premises control and multi-cloud flexibility. By assessing your workloads, security needs, and business objectives, you can determine the most effective cloud strategy to drive growth, innovation, and efficiency.

blog,Benefits of Cloud Computing in Banking: Compliance & Customer Experience,"Benefits of Cloud Computing in Banking: Compliance & Customer Experience Rayna Guha February 19, 2025 Home >> Insights >> Blog >> Benefits of Cloud Computing in Banking: Compliance & Customer Experience Before making the leap to the cloud, it’s crucial for banks and insurers to understand what cloud services bring to the table. Did you know? The global cloud computing banking market is projected to reach $301 billion by 2032! That’s because cloud computing is revolutionizing the banking and insurance industry, making operations more agile, cost-effective, and secure. As financial institutions navigate an increasingly digital world, cloud adoption has become more of a necessity than an option. From enhancing data security to enabling seamless digital banking experiences, the cloud is setting new standards in efficiency and innovation. Benefits of Cloud Computing in Banking 1. Cost Efficiency Cloud computing significantly reduces infrastructure costs by shifting from expensive on-premises data centers to on-demand cloud services. Banks no longer need to invest heavily in physical hardware, and instead, they can rely on cloud providers to manage the infrastructure. Additionally, by optimizing resource usage, cloud computing in banking lowers energy consumption, ensuring that financial institutions only pay for the computing power they use. This shift minimizes idle resources, leading to more efficient operational spending and allowing banks to focus their budgets on innovation and customer service. 2. Enhanced Business Continuity Financial institutions cannot afford downtime, as even a minor disruption can result in significant losses. Cloud computing in banking ensures high availability and fault tolerance with redundant data storage and automated backup mechanisms. Disaster recovery solutions built into cloud platforms provide an additional safety net, ensuring seamless restoration of critical banking applications. This guarantees uninterrupted banking services, enhances customer trust, and safeguards institutions from data loss due to unforeseen incidents. 3. Scalability and Flexibility The banking industry experiences fluctuating demands, during peak times, such as salary days or tax seasons, transaction volumes surge. Cloud platforms allow banks to scale resources up or down as needed, ensuring optimal performance at all times. Furthermore, launching new banking services or applications becomes significantly faster with cloud infrastructure. This enables financial institutions to remain agile and respond to market needs without the delays associated with traditional IT provisioning. 4. Usage-Based Payment Model Cloud computing in banking introduces a pay-as-you-go model, allowing banks to only pay for the computing resources they use. This eliminates the financial burden of maintaining underutilized infrastructure and provides greater control over IT expenses. With predictable cost structures, banks can manage budgets effectively while ensuring access to cutting-edge cloud services that enhance operational efficiency. 5. Environmental Sustainability Sustainability is a growing priority for banks and insurance firms. By adopting cloud computing, financial institutions significantly reduce their carbon footprint. Cloud providers operate energy-efficient data centers designed to optimize power usage and cooling, leading to lower overall energy consumption. By eliminating the need for constant hardware upgrades and reducing electronic waste, banks contribute to greener IT practices and align with global sustainability initiatives. Challenges in Adopting Cloud Computing Despite its numerous advantages, transitioning to the cloud presents certain challenges for financial institutions. 1. Data Security and Privacy Concerns Given the sensitive nature of financial data, banks must ensure that cloud solutions comply with industry regulations. Data breaches, cyber threats, and unauthorized access pose significant risks, requiring banks to implement robust encryption, multi-factor authentication, and continuous monitoring to safeguard customer information. 2. Integration with Legacy Systems Many financial institutions still operate on legacy systems that were not originally designed for cloud environments. Migrating these systems to the cloud without disrupting banking operations is a complex challenge. Seamless integration between old and new infrastructures requires careful planning, custom solutions, and sometimes, a hybrid approach to ensure smooth functionality. 3. Regulatory Compliance The financial sector is heavily regulated, with compliance requirements varying by region. Banks adopting cloud services must navigate complex regulatory frameworks, ensuring that their cloud environments are auditable and meet local and international legal standards. Achieving full transparency in cloud operations while maintaining data sovereignty adds another layer of complexity to cloud adoption. Choosing the Right Cloud Service Model for Banks Banks have multiple cloud service models to choose from, each offering unique benefits and challenges. Public Cloud A public cloud is a shared computing environment where multiple organizations use the same cloud infrastructure provided by a third-party vendor.

Embrace Zero Trust Architecture Picture this: a security model where no one—inside or outside your network—is trusted by default. That’s Zero Trust in action. It’s all about verifying every access request, every time. Why it matters: It keeps insider threats and unauthorized access in check. The upside: – You gain control over who accesses what. – Threats stay locked out, even if they’re already inside. 2. Don’t Skip Multi-Factor Authentication Passwords alone? Not enough anymore. MFA adds an extra layer of protection by requiring users to verify their identity in more than one way. Why it matters: It’s one of the easiest ways to prevent account takeovers. The upside: – Fewer breaches. – Your compliance checklist just got a lot shorter. 3. Automate Threat Detection and Response Imagine if your systems could spot a cyber threat and act on it before you even knew it existed. That’s the magic of automation with AI and ML. Why it matters: Speed is critical when dealing with threats. The upside: – Faster threat neutralization. – Less manual work (and fewer headaches). 4.

DevSecOps ensures security issues are caught and fixed during development. Why it matters: Prevention is always cheaper than the cure. The upside: – Fewer last-minute surprises. – Faster, safer product launches. 7. Tighten Access with Identity and Access Management Who’s accessing what? IAM tools help you answer that question and ensure no one is overstepping. Why it matters: Overprivileged users are a major security risk. The upside: – Cleaner, more controlled access. – A clear view of user activity for better monitoring. 8. Back Up Data and Plan for Disasters Things can and will go wrong. Whether it’s a ransomware attack or a natural disaster, having a solid backup and disaster recovery plan ensures you can bounce back quickly. Why it matters: Downtime costs more than you think. The upside: – Your data is never truly “lost.” – You can keep the business running, no matter what. 9. Train Your Team, Again We all know human error is a major cause of security breaches. Training on cloud security methods ensures your employees know how to spot phishing scams and avoid common pitfalls. Why it matters: Your team is your first line of defense. The upside: – Fewer accidental clicks on malicious links. – A workplace culture that values security 10. Keep Up with Compliance Regulations aren’t going anywhere, and staying on top of them is non-negotiable. Make it a habit to review and update your compliance measures. Why it matters: Non-compliance costs can hit hard. The upside: – You avoid hefty fines. – Customers and partners trust you more. Implementing these top cloud security strategies for CIOs is essential for maintaining a resilient and secure cloud environment. By adopting cloud security best practices such as Zero Trust Architecture, MFA, encryption, and automated threat detection, organizations can mitigate risks and stay ahead of cyber threats.

blog,VMware to AWS Migration Step by Step: A Complete 7 Step Guide,"VMware to AWS Migration Step by Step: A Complete 7 Step Guide Saakshi jaiswal January 23, 2025 Home >> Insights >> Blog >> VMware to AWS Migration Step by Step: A Complete 7 Step Guide Are you feeling the pressure from Broadcom’s VMware shift? With costs skyrocketing by up to 5x, many organizations are reassessing their options for managing and scaling their infrastructure. As the leading cloud provider, AWS offers a powerful alternative, enabling companies to reduce expenses, boost productivity, and accelerate innovation. On average, organizations opting for VMware to AWS migration experience: 20% savings on infrastructure costs, 66% increase in administrator productivity, and a 43% faster time to market for new features. If you’re considering a VMware migration to AWS to overcome rising costs, modernize, or leverage the cloud, a successful transition requires strategic planning. This checklist will help IT leaders evaluate their readiness for a VMware to AWS migration step by step, covering key areas from infrastructure to security, to ensure a smooth, efficient process. 1.Evaluate Your Current VMware Environment Inventory of Resources: Start by listing all VMware resources, including compute, storage, and network assets. Assess how heavily each resource is utilized to get a clear picture of what will need to be migrated and what could potentially be optimized in AWS. Identify Dependencies: VMware workloads often have dependencies on other applications, databases, and services. Mapping these dependencies is critical to prevent disruptions when migrate Vm to AWS. Performance Metrics: Gather performance data—like CPU and memory usage—across workloads. This baseline will help you evaluate performance improvements (or issues) post-migration and ensure AWS configurations meet your needs. 2.Assess Migration Goals and Objectives Define Business Objectives: Clearly outline the goals of VMware to AWS migration. Are you seeking scalability, better disaster recovery, or long-term cost savings? Defined objectives will guide every phase of the migration. Set Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Establish specific KPIs to measure migration success, such as reduced operational costs or faster disaster recovery times. Determine Migration Timeline: Set a realistic timeline for migration that minimizes disruptions to business operations, identifying critical phases and any potential impacts. 3.Analyze Security and Compliance Requirements Evaluate Security Protocols: Ensure that AWS security features align with your VMware protocols and company policies. AWS offers a variety of security tools, such as Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon GuardDuty, to protect data and applications. Compliance Check: Verify that AWS meets all regulatory and compliance requirements relevant to your industry, whether it’s HIPAA, GDPR, or other standards. Data Protection and Encryption: Identify sensitive data that requires encryption or additional security and explore AWS services that ensure compliance and data integrity, like AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption. 4.Examine Networking and Connectivity Needs Network Architecture Mapping: Map your current VMware network architecture to understand what needs to be replicated on AWS. AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Direct Connect can help maintain a seamless network transition. Bandwidth and Latency Requirements: Assess your network’s bandwidth and latency to ensure it can handle data transfer without affecting user experience during migration. Hybrid Cloud Considerations: For those planning a hybrid setup, VMware Cloud on AWS enables you to bridge your on-premises data center with AWS, providing flexibility and reducing migration complexity. 5. Estimate Cost and Budget Requirements Calculate Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): Conduct a TCO analysis comparing your current VMware environment with AWS. Factor in migration costs, training, and potential long-term savings. AWS Cost Management Tools: Familiarize your team with AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets, which can help track and optimize spending once your Vmware workloads are in the cloud. Potential Savings: Highlight potential savings areas, such as scaling compute and storage based on demand, or leveraging AWS’s pricing models to reduce costs. 6. Plan for Staff Training and Skill Development Identify Skills Gaps: VMware to AWS migration requires new skills. Determine where your team may need AWS training, particularly for areas like cloud security and management. AWS Training Resources: Invest in AWS training and certifications to ensure your team is equipped for the transition. AWS offers resources like AWS Training and Certification programs to get your team cloud-ready. Change Management Strategy: Develop a communication and change management plan to keep everyone informed, engaged, and prepared for the transition’s impact on daily operations. 7. Set Up Monitoring and Management Post-Migration Establish Monitoring KPIs: Identify critical metrics to monitor on AWS, such as resource utilization, performance, and cost efficiency, to track post-migration performance. Management and Support Setup: Decide whether to manage AWS in-house or work with a managed services provider (MSP) such as Rapyder for continuous support and optimization. Create a Feedback Loop: Plan regular reviews to assess the success of the migration and adjust as necessary. A feedback loop will help identify potential improvements and maximize the benefits of your new AWS environment. How Rapyder can Help?

blog,Backup as a Service – Explained!,"Backup as a Service – Explained! Rayna Guha November 8, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Blog >> Backup as a Service – Explained! Online backup services, often referred to as cloud backup or Backup as a Service (BaaS), provide a convenient method for securely storing data offsite. This service allows files, folders, or entire hard drive contents to be regularly backed up to a remote, cloud-based data repository via a network connection. The primary goal of online backup is to safeguard information—whether business-related or personal—from the risks of data loss due to user error, hacking, or technological failures. Rather than relying on a centralized, on-premises IT department, BaaS connects systems to a cloud environment, which can be private, public, or hybrid, managed by an external provider. This approach simplifies data management significantly. Instead of dealing with the complexities of rotating and managing tapes or hard disks at an offsite location, data storage administrators can delegate maintenance and management tasks to the service provider. What is Backup as a Service (BaaS)? Backup as a Service (BaaS) is a model where a service provider offers backup services to businesses on a subscription basis. The service provider is responsible for storing the data and ensuring its availability when needed. This model eliminates the need for businesses to manage their own backup infrastructure, thereby reducing costs and complexity. Why Do Customers Choose BaaS? Acc. to Veeam’s report, 40% desire flexible payment options. Data is the lifeblood of any organization. Astonishingly, 60% of companies that lose critical data shut down within six months. For software-as-a-service (SaaS) customers, data loss is a significant concern because SaaS vendors’ backup policies often fall short of guaranteeing a complete and rapid restoration of lost data. Risks such as user error, hacking, synchronization issues, or malicious insiders can all jeopardize data. However, the anxiety and potential for data loss can be mitigated by pairing SaaS applications with a comprehensive Backup as a Service (BaaS) solution for backup and recovery. How Does BaaS Work? BaaS works by replicating and storing data from a business’s servers to a secure, offsite location. This data can be accessed and restored in the event of data loss, ensuring business continuity. The service provider manages the backup process, freeing up the business’s IT resources for other tasks. Benefits of BaaS Cost-Effective: BaaS eliminates the need for businesses to invest in their own backup infrastructure, resulting in significant cost savings. Scalability: BaaS allows businesses to easily scale their backup needs as their data grows. Security: Service providers often have robust security measures in place to protect stored data. Ease of Use: With BaaS, businesses don’t need to worry about managing the backup process, making it an easy and convenient solution. Why Rapyder as a Partner? With Rapyder’s instant recovery and user-friendly solution, you can be confident that your data is always protected. Our software-defined backup service works with any storage setup, so you can easily get started and ensure your critical information is always secure. Conclusion We can conclude that BaaS offers businesses an economical, scalable, and secure means to protect their data. By outsourcing the backup process to a service provider, businesses can focus on their core functions, knowing that their data is safe and accessible when needed. As data continues to grow in importance, BaaS is set to become an increasingly popular choice for businesses of all sizes. To secure your infrastructure, contact us!

blog,Securing Your Digital Empire: AWS Disaster Recovery Guide,"Securing Your Digital Empire: AWS Disaster Recovery Guide Saakshi jaiswal October 23, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Blog >> Securing Your Digital Empire: AWS Disaster Recovery Guide Today, businesses rely heavily on data and technology for their day-to-day operations. Any disruption, whether due to natural disasters, cyber-attacks, or system failures, can lead to significant financial loss, damage to reputation, and operational downtime. Hence, having a robust disaster recovery plan is crucial to ensuring business continuity and data protection. This blog aims to provide a comprehensive guide on AWS Disaster Recovery, helping you understand its importance, explore the various options available, and learn how to implement and manage an effective disaster recovery strategy using AWS. Understanding AWS Disaster Recovery Disaster recovery encapsulates a set of policies, tools, and procedures designed to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced disaster. It focuses on restoring data, applications, and IT resources to minimize downtime and mitigate data loss. AWS offers a range of disaster recovery services tailored to meet different business needs. These services ensure that your data and applications are safe and can be quickly restored in an emergency. AWS’s scalable and reliable infrastructure provides a solid foundation for implementing a disaster recovery plan. Risks of Not Having a Disaster Recovery Plan Without a disaster recovery plan, businesses are vulnerable to several risks, including: Data Loss: The absence of a disaster recovery plan puts critical business data at risk of permanent loss. This includes customer information, financial records, and intellectual property. Irretrievable data can cripple operations, hinder decision-making, and lead to costly delays in resuming normal business functions. Downtime: Without a structured recovery plan, businesses may experience extended periods of downtime during a disaster. Prolonged inactivity not only disrupts daily operations but also affects overall productivity and can lead to significant revenue loss. The longer the downtime, the greater the negative impact on the company’s ability to serve its customers and meet its operational goals. Financial Loss: The financial implications of not having a disaster recovery plan can be severe. Direct costs include loss of income during downtime, while indirect costs encompass long-term financial consequences such as loss of customer trust, decreased market share, and potential loss of future business opportunities. Additionally, emergency response and recovery efforts can incur substantial unexpected expenses. Reputational Damage: Inadequate disaster recovery planning can lead to reputational harm as customers and stakeholders lose confidence in the company’s ability to manage and protect their information. Reputational damage can result in decreased customer loyalty, negative media coverage, and a diminished brand image, which may have lasting effects on the business’s market position and customer base. Regulatory Non-compliance: Many industries are subject to regulatory requirements concerning data protection and business continuity. Failure to implement a disaster recovery plan can result in non-compliance with these regulations, leading to legal repercussions, including fines and sanctions. Additionally, regulatory bodies may impose stricter oversight, further complicating business operations. Traditional Disaster Recovery vs. Cloud-Based Disaster Recovery Traditional Disaster Recovery (DR) Infrastructure Requirements: Traditional DR often relies on dedicated physical infrastructure that mirrors the primary data center. This involves setting up a secondary site with hardware and software similar to the primary site, which can be costly and complex to maintain. Cost: The initial investment in traditional DR is typically high due to the need for redundant hardware, real estate, and facilities. Ongoing maintenance costs also add to the financial burden, including power, cooling, and physical security. Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Traditional DR may have longer RTOs due to the time required to activate and synchronize the secondary site. The process involves manual intervention and can be slow, impacting the speed of recovery. Scalability: Scaling traditional DR solutions often requires significant physical and financial resources. Expanding capacity involves purchasing additional hardware and managing physical space, which can be cumbersome and inflexible. Maintenance and Management: Managing traditional DR solutions involves regular testing, updates, and maintenance of physical infrastructure. This requires dedicated IT staff and resources to ensure that the secondary site remains operational and up-to-date. Complexity: The complexity of traditional DR setups can be high, requiring intricate planning and coordination to ensure that all systems, applications, and data are adequately replicated and can be quickly restored. Cloud-Based Disaster Recovery (DR) Infrastructure Requirements: Cloud-based DR leverages virtualized infrastructure provided by cloud service providers. This eliminates the need for a secondary physical site, as data and applications are replicated in the cloud, offering a more flexible and scalable solution. Cost: Cloud-based DR typically involves a pay-as-you-go pricing model, reducing the need for large upfront investments. Costs are based on actual usage, including storage and compute resources, making it a more cost-effective option compared to traditional DR. Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Cloud-based DR often provides faster RTOs due to automated recovery processes and the ability to quickly access replicated data and applications. Cloud services can often be activated with minimal manual intervention, speeding up the recovery process. Scalability: Cloud-based DR solutions offer high scalability, allowing businesses to easily adjust their DR resources based on current needs. Expanding or contracting capacity is straightforward and can be done without significant investment in physical infrastructure. Maintenance and Management: Cloud-based DR reduces the burden of maintenance and management, as cloud service providers handle infrastructure updates, security, and availability. This allows businesses to focus on their core operations rather than managing physical DR infrastructure. Complexity: While cloud-based DR simplifies many aspects of disaster recovery, it requires a different approach to planning and implementation. Businesses must adapt to cloud-based tools and processes, but overall complexity is often reduced compared to traditional DR.

blog,What Are Regulatory Compliance Issues In Cloud Computing and How To Overcome It,"What Are Regulatory Compliance Issues In Cloud Computing and How To Overcome It Saakshi jaiswal October 10, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Blog >> What Are Regulatory Compliance Issues In Cloud Computing and How To Overcome It In the world of cloud computing, regulatory compliance is a major concern for businesses. This blog will delve into the various regulatory compliance issues businesses face in cloud computing and offer solutions for overcoming them. What is regulatory compliance? Regulatory compliance refers to adhering to laws, regulations, guidelines, and standards applicable to a particular industry or business. It involves ensuring that a company’s operations, policies, and procedures comply with the rules and regulations set forth by governing bodies. When it comes to cloud computing, regulatory compliance means that cloud service providers comply with legal and industry standards relating to the privacy, security, and accessibility of data. By adhering to these regulations, cloud providers operate within the limits of the law and ethical boundaries while providing cloud services to their customers. Regulatory compliance is a crucial aspect of cloud computing that assures clients of their data’s protection and privacy. What role does Cloud regulatory compliance play in businesses? Cloud regulatory compliance plays a vital role in businesses as it helps organizations operate securely and safely. Below are some key points that highlight the importance of regulatory compliance in cloud computing: Regulatory compliance in cloud computing ensures that organizations meet legal and industry standards relating to data privacy, security, and accessibility. This minimizes the risk of data breaches and ensures that organizations operate within legal and ethical boundaries. Cloud regulatory compliance is particularly critical in industries that handle sensitive data, such as healthcare, finance, and government. Compliance with regulations like HIPAA and PCI DSS ensures that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access and disclosure. Cloud providers like AWS and Azure have their own regulatory compliance standards, and businesses must ensure that their cloud service providers comply with these regulations. Incompetence to do so can result in legal and financial consequences. Compliance with cloud computing regulatory requirements can help businesses gain a competitive advantage by demonstrating their commitment to data privacy and security. Regular monitoring and auditing of cloud service providers can help businesses maintain compliance and reduce the risk of data breaches. Regulatory compliance issues in cloud computing Regulatory compliance issues in cloud computing arise from businesses entrusting their data to third-party cloud providers. Here are some common regulatory compliance issues in cloud computing: Data privacy:Many regulatory frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), require businesses to protect personal data privacy. In the Cloud, this can be challenging because the data is stored in a shared environment, and businesses must ensure that the cloud provider has adequate privacy controls in place. Data security:Data breaches in the Cloud can result in significant financial and reputational damage. Regulatory compliance requires businesses to implement adequate security controls to protect data in the Cloud. Data residency: Many regulations require businesses to store data in specific locations or jurisdictions. In the Cloud, data is often stored in multiple locations, making it challenging for businesses to ensure compliance with data residency requirements. Auditability:Many regulations require businesses to maintain audit trails and ensure data can be accessed and reviewed. In the Cloud, businesses must ensure that the cloud provider can provide the necessary audit trails and access controls. Compliance certifications: Many regulations require businesses to obtain specific certifications, such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, or HIPAA. In the Cloud, businesses must ensure that the cloud provider has these certifications or can provide the necessary compliance controls. Regulatory compliance issues in cloud computing require businesses to carefully consider their cloud provider’s capabilities and ensure they have the necessary controls to meet regulatory requirements. How to overcome Cloud regulatory compliance issues? Overcoming cloud regulatory compliance issues can be a challenging task for businesses, but there are several steps that organizations can take to address these issues. Here are some ways to overcome Cloud regulatory compliance issues: Understand the regulations: Businesses should ensure they understand the regulations that apply to their industry and the cloud service provider they use. This includes both regulatory requirements and industry standards. Select a compliant cloud service provider: Businesses should choose a cloud service provider that complies with the relevant regulations and has the necessary certifications and audits. Implement compliance controls: Organizations should implement controls to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, such as access controls, data encryption, and regular audits. For example, AWS and Azure comply with various regulatory requirements and have extensive compliance programs. Regularly monitor and assess compliance: Organizations should regularly monitor and assess compliance with regulations and industry standards to identify and address any compliance issues. Train employees: It’s essential to train employees on compliance policies and procedures to ensure that they understand their role in maintaining regulatory compliance. Businesses can overcome cloud regulatory compliance issues by understanding the regulations, selecting a compliant cloud service provider, implementing compliance controls, regularly monitoring compliance, and training employees on compliance policies and procedures.

blog,The Role of a CIO in Digital Transformation,"The Role of a CIO in Digital Transformation Saakshi jaiswal October 8, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Blog >> The Role of a CIO in Digital Transformation Technology continues to become increasingly complex and important. In almost all sectors, not keeping pace with the technology in the market is detrimental to an organization’s success. In the midst of all that are Chief Information Officers (CIOs) who’re in charge of managing IT to deliver outcomes. And right now is the worst time to be a CIO of average capabilities. Gone are the days when CIOs could simply manage the IT department and call it a day. To drive a company’s success, CIOs now need to leverage technology and create value. To do this, they need to move away from a functional role to a strategic leader and bring about a tech transformation in the company. How to Bring About a Tech Transformation Before a CIO understands their role as a strategic leader, it is important to understand technological transformation itself. Mostly, they’re implemented in a disjointed manner across the IT department. This leads to under-delivery and time stalls. To come to terms with the scope of the transformation itself, the CIO first needs to think in these 3 directions. Reimagine the role of tech This includes establishing technology as an innovation and business partner to deliver a tech-driven strategy for conducting business. Tech-enabled products and services and their integration into management across the business are some of its examples. By doing this, the first step in the digital transformation of a business will be complete. Redefine delivery of tech By embracing agile, technology can be delivered in a smooth and customized manner. Improving IT services by integrating with next-gen technologies like SAAS, cloud, and automation will help improve the overall delivery of IT services. This can be improved by developing partnerships with other tech firms and segregating workers into small teams built around top engineers. Prepare for the Future Technological advancement is still rapid. Innovations enter the market every day. To keep pace with it, CIOs need to implement a flexible approach in their IT upgrades. By using a flexible architecture that is capable of integrating with future upgrades, the IT department will be future-proofed. How to be a Transformative CIO A transformative CIO needs the appropriate skill set and capabilities to turn the IT into a driver of value. Here are some of the surefire ways through which a CIO can be the harbinger of digital change. Be a business leader To generate value through IT, a CIO will need to understand business strategy. Top IT companies know this. This is why their CIO will be far more involved in shaping business strategies than others. CIOs who upgrade themselves for this tend to learn their business inside out. The best CIOs go beyond their means to get involved in business strategy. They invest their time and effort in gaining an in-depth understanding of their business. By doing this, they’ll be able to take charge of initiatives that have a business impact. Such initiatives allow CIOs to develop an understanding of the business implications of tech through first-hand experience. Be the agent of change A technological transformation is not about shoving cloud services or IT solutions down the throat of workers. It’s about integrating the smallest task with technology effectively to improve performance. By partnering with other business leaders from IT companies, organizations can work towards common goals through mutual responsibility. Gaining support from the higher-ups for a digital transformation not only involves explaining how but also why. For instance, executives can see the cloud as a cost-saving opportunity. But by making them understand the full range of cloud benefits, the CIO can help unlock new revenue models and services. Be on the lookout for talent The skill gap among teams is one of the top obstacles to a successful tech transformation. A CIO will need to focus on the recruitment of top talent and their retention. It can only be implemented by recruiting talented workers who understand the technology. This calls for specific attention to the recruitment process from the CIO. It is also equally important to keep good workers. Hiring them doesn’t matter if you can’t keep them. The best CIOs thus need to be diverse so that their talent can advance in their area. For instance, by letting a top-class software engineer advance while coding instead of forcing them into a management role. Be a cultural revolutionary A top CIO will build a true community. Pay matters, but validation also does. The best people want to go where they feel valued and necessary. By providing engineers with more autonomy and reducing managers, a camaraderie among workers is built. Promoting collaboration across various teams is also a crucial factor in a successful transformation. It is up to the CIO to enable opportunities for collaboration. The best CIO will ensure that collaboration is the norm instead of an exception. Be a tech translator Executives are often wary of undergoing tech transformation. Previous experiences have proven expensive, and nobody is eager to undergo it again. To address this, CIOs need to play an active role and intimate the role of these technologies to the executives. Be sure to make their implications clear and precise. Most decisions regarding tech are not scrutinized. A good CIO will not settle for that and instead articulate how a solution will solve the problem. All the while having alternative approaches in tow.

In an ever-increasing technology driver world, the role of a CIO is no longer a simple one. They’re legitimate contenders to lead business and, just like everything else, need to transform and pick up the role of a strategic leader.

blog,Difference Between Dedicated Server and Cloud Server- An Overview,"Difference Between Dedicated Server and Cloud Server- An Overview Saakshi jaiswal October 3, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Blog >> Difference Between Dedicated Server and Cloud Server- An Overview One of the most important decisions to be made for an organization is choosing between a cloud server and a dedicated server. Every day we see a lot of debate around the same topic, which is more budget friendly, is cloud more cutting-edge, do dedicated servers provide better performance over cloud server, what are the similarities and differences. Why should you know the difference between these two servers? Let’s say if you plan to create a website or web application someday, you may want to understand what a server is. Plus, what makes it possible for your website to be accessible to the people on the net. So, here’s the simple answer. Every website or web app needs a server to be published and make it accessible on the internet. The role of a server is to link your website or application to the internet, allowing people across the globe to connect with it. However, it’s not enough to know about servers when you decide to run a business. Setting up a website and setting up the success for your business go hand in hand. Now, here comes the confusion of choosing among the various web hosting servers available on the Internet that people face. This article gives you a good idea of which server you should go for and which has more advantages. Cloud Server and Dedicated Server Here’s a brief comparison of the two most popular servers: dedicated server and cloud server describing their advantages and disadvantages along with their features. Dedicated Server A dedicated server is a physical server where the customer can buy the complete server to themselves instead of having to share the server space and resources with other customers. This server allows web developers to install custom programming languages, tools, utilities, and third-party frameworks to program complex, database-driven applications. Big firms handling a lot of traffic usually go for dedicated servers due to the advantage of customization it offers. Cloud Server Cloud hosting or cloud server is a way of distributing data among multiple servers in different locations, using cloud computing technology. In other words, cloud hosting uses multiple virtual servers and uses various systems to manage your website thus offering you high scalability and resources. Since it’s a virtual platform, you pay only for the resources and space you need which saves you unnecessary additional costs. Cloud hosting is usually preferred by both small and big firms to host their applications due to the security, analytics, ease of scalability, 24×7 support, on-demand infrastrcuture and some examples of cloud hosting providers include AWS, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean etc. Cloud vs Dedicated server – Key differences Performance If a business wants fast processing and retrieval of information, a dedicated server will fulfil this need as it processes data locally. Dedicated servers perform functions faster without facing lag and thus become the ideal fit for businesses where speed is an important factor. Whereas the processing with cloud servers becomes slow as it goes through the SAN to access data which can slow the performance. A working internet condition is most important for cloud servers to show maximum performance. Scalability It’s easy to increase or decrease resources in cloud hosting as the server is partitioned in a virtual environment. This makes it easy to add additional computing and storage resources. Scalability is one of the main reasons for the cloud’s increasing popularity and demand in businesses. Not only can data storage capacity, processing power and networking be adjusted as per needs using existing cloud computing infrastructure but scaling with the cloud is also super quick and easy. However, dedicated servers cannot scale easily because of their rigid specifications. The change of processors on a dedicated server without maintenance also requires more time and resources. Dedicated Server & Cloud Migration If you decide to migrate with a dedicated server, you will need more planning as compared to the cloud server. Without a full-scale plan on how to create and execute the migration, it won’t be possible to have a seamless migration using a dedicated server. On the other hand, the important question to ask when it comes to cloud migration is whether or not your application is compatible with the cloud. Plus, if they have enterprise licensing that would be impacted differently by a multi-tenant environment. Only after considering all these factors, you can make your decision to switch. You must also ensure that you have backups until the new environment becomes fully functional. However, a cloud expert can definitely help you with data migration in a faster way as compared to data migration in dedicated servers where data loss is a major issue. Operations & Server Management Cloud servers shine when it comes to maintenance and monitoring. While the responsibility to monitor and manage your server rests on you with dedicated servers, cloud servers come with multiple dashboards and tools allowing the customers to set up alerts and alarms to monitor individual components such as memory, compute, and networks. Usually a cloud service provider handles all this and becomes much easier to stay on cloud than dedicated servers. Server Cost Comparison The cost of hosting depends on a lot of factors including server set-up timeline, compliance requirements configuration, management, and support. When we consider all these, cloud computing is more cost-efficient than dedicated servers as the model involves the billing of only those computing resources you use. However, despite having lower entry costs than dedicated servers, over time, the cost-efficiency of cloud hosting reduces. This is because the storage keeps filling up with each file added, and it keeps getting expensive until there’s no difference in the dedicated and cloud server with respect to the cost. Which Server Is the Right Fit For Your Business? Each server has its own advantages and disadvantages. So before you select a server for your business, it’s important to invest enough time to understand the specific needs and goals of your business, and the kind of customers it caters to. However, owing to the features that come with cloud hosting, the majority of businesses today are moving to the cloud. And this shift has some valid reasons. Cloud is not just cost-efficient but also offers scalability, and flexibility and allows you to use much more technologies than possible with a dedicated server. Cloud servers are also preferred for e-commerce websites with unpredictable and fluctuating demands, for SMB websites looking for cost efficiency and for testing new websites in general. Put simply, cloud hosting has become the go-to server for businesses today as it helps them meet the customers’ requirements most optimally. Yet, as mentioned earlier, selecting the right server business depends completely on your business goals. So, make sure you consider which server would be most suitable to meet your business goals!

blog,5 Reasons Why Multi-Cloud Infrastructure is The Future of Enterprise IT,"5 Reasons Why Multi-Cloud Infrastructure is The Future of Enterprise IT Saakshi jaiswal September 19, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Blog >> 5 Reasons Why Multi-Cloud Infrastructure is The Future of Enterprise IT In recent times, multi-cloud has become the first preference for many enterprises with IT needs. Enterprises across the globe are choosing multi-cloud for their IT needs. According to a 2021 report by Faction Inc, 92% of businesses globally have multi-cloud strategies in place or are working on them. By 2027, more than 70% of enterprises will use industry cloud platforms to accelerate their business initiatives, predicts Gartner. The number of organizations adopting a multi-cloud strategy to meet their business goals is on the rise. But before we move to understand why the multi-cloud infrastructure is the future of enterprise, let’s try to get an overview of what multi-cloud infrastructure really is. What is Multi-Cloud Infrastructure? The concept of multi-cloud refers to the use of multiple cloud providers in conjunction with different workloads. It allows businesses to leverage multiple clouds simultaneously. This infrastructure when employed in your business blends different solutions from different providers together creating a customized environment for your organization. When there are multiple clouds for performing different functions like CRM, storage, big data processing etc., your customers get the maximum benefits. While the public cloud offers cost savings, the private cloud offers performance, security, and control. The Advantages of Implementing a Multi-Cloud Strategy The reasons which drive businesses to adopt multi-cloud strategy are numerous. Some of these include affordability, security, competition, regulation & standardization, and agility. In this article, we’ll look at five main reasons for the increased popularity of multi-cloud infrastructure. 1. Multi-Cloud Allows Enterprises to Choose the Most Cost-Effective Solution Multi-cloud environments significantly reduce the cost of businesses as setting up and consumption of cloud through multi-cloud environments is more affordable than on-premises and single-cloud environments. This is because businesses can select the features, functionality and pricing per their needs and requirement when opting for multi-cloud infrastructure. This is not possible with on-prem environments that need hardware upgrades for scaling up resulting in either higher initial costs or upgrade costs. 2. Helps Enterprises Avoid Vendor Lock-in Vendor lock-in is a situation that arises when an enterprise is limited to just one vendor for all its cloud requirements. This makes it almost impossible for the enterprise to integrate third-party services or migrate to another vendor in turn making the company totally dependent on that vendor. On the other hand, a multi-cloud environment lets businesses diversify their cloud vendors as well as services without any technical challenges. Hence, going for multi-cloud seems like a better option for businesses that don’t want to restrict their options when it comes to selecting the services and integrating them. They can go for a cost-effective, better service whenever they want with multi-cloud. 3. It Introduces IT Scalability and Business Agility One of the most important features of the cloud that makes the decision to adopt it easier for businesses is its ability to provide businesses with agility and scalability. And with multi-cloud, this increases multifold. Companies request a certain number of resources. The vendor delivers them and charges accordingly. This pay-per-use model is flexible, delivers on time, and allows enterprises to increase or decrease the request for resources as per requirements. In other words, the operations improve significantly as there’s no redundancy or wastage and lower costs. Plus, scaling up becomes more efficient because of the flexibility this model comes with making it the choice for most businesses. 4.Improves Performance Cloud computing has revolutionized the way businesses operate. By Offloading work to the cloud, you can improve performance by eliminating the need for local servers. This means that your applications will run faster and be more reliable because there is no need to worry about maintenance or hardware issues. Moreover, using multiple AZs and regions allows you to get additional levels of redundancy with your application. This ensures that if one region goes down, your applications will continue to operate as normal in other regions. And finally, by implementing global CDNs, you can speed up content delivery across different geographies. 5.Enhances the Security of Data and Applications Security vulnerabilities are always there in any IT environment making it crucial for businesses to add robust security measures. Multi-cloud is a cloud computing model where different clouds are used to run individual applications or services. This allows businesses to keep their data safe by storing it in various cloud platforms by using multiple cloud services. Data is still available from other sources if one service crashes or fails. A hybrid multi-cloud model gives enterprises the best of both worlds: the security benefits of private clouds combined with the scalability and availability advantages offered by public cloud technologies. Multi cloud infrastructure benefits customers by eliminating risks of single-point dependency on one provider and provides flexibility. It helps reduce cost by helping you select a competitor based on services provided. Trying to move into multi cloud infrastructure but have questions?

Let’s explore the essentials of cloud computing for small businesses and its potential impact on your operations. Cost-effectiveness and scalability: There are no upfront costs associated with purchasing and maintaining physical servers and software licences. Many cloud computing firms offer pay-as-you-go models, which allow small businesses to only pay for the resources they use. This leads to significant cost savings, freeing up valuable capital that can be invested in other areas of the business. For instance, small businesses can reallocate funds saved from IT infrastructure to marketing or product development. Cloud computing also offers exceptional scalability. As a business grows, owners can easily adjust their cloud storage and service plans to accommodate expanding needs. No more worrying about expensive hardware upgrades or underutilised resources – the cloud scales with the business. Security and Reliability Data security is a major concern for any business. Cloud service providers invest heavily in robust security measures, including data encryption, firewalls, and disaster recovery plans. According to a report by McAfee, 52% of businesses experience better security in the cloud than on-premises. This ensures that business data is far more secure than it might be on a local server vulnerable to physical threats or hardware failures. Moreover, cloud-based systems offer superior reliability. Data is replicated across multiple servers, minimising downtime and ensuring business continuity even in the event of hardware malfunctions. For instance, if one server fails, another can take over immediately, preventing data loss and service interruptions. This is crucial for maintaining operations, especially for businesses that rely on real-time data access and processing. Collaboration and Accessibility Employees can access essential files, applications, and data from anywhere with an internet connection. This flexibility is crucial in today’s business environment, where remote work has become more common. Cloud computing firms provide solutions that encourage teamwork and productivity by offering tools that support collaboration. For example, team members can work on the same document simultaneously, share updates in real-time, and communicate effectively through integrated messaging platforms. Cloud-based solutions also offer increased accessibility for business owners, who can monitor operations and make critical decisions from any location. Whether travelling for business or working from home, small business owners have the flexibility to stay connected and manage their company effectively. Automatic Software Updates and Maintenance Gone are the days of managing time-consuming software updates and system maintenance. Cloud service providers handle these tasks automatically. Thus, ensuring that the systems are always up-to-date with the latest security patches and features. This automation frees up the IT team to focus on more strategic initiatives that contribute directly to business growth. For small businesses, it can even eliminate the need for a dedicated IT team altogether. When considering a cloud solution company, weigh the advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing carefully. Evaluate your business needs, budget, and long-term goals to determine if cloud solutions align with your objectives. Consult with cloud computing firms to understand their offerings and how they can meet your specific requirements. By considering both the benefits and potential drawbacks, you can make an informed decision that supports your business’s growth and operational efficiency.

Enterprises with outdated legacy applications are now looking for ways to modernize their offerings with latest technology. Businesses today need to evolve continuously and adapt as per the market needs. Else it’s bound to fail sooner or later with its old methods of operating. Operating in the new digital arena with the old legacy system is no more considered business friendly and can be catastrophic to business survival. If you want your business to have a competitive edge and catering to growing demands by tech-savvy consumers, updating the legacy systems is the way to go. Why modernize your legacy applications? Let’s look at some of the main reasons why modernizing your legacy applications is vital for the success of your business. Improve Performance Using old legacy systems can lead to slow speed, sub-optimal UI/UX along with greater difficulty in maintaining updates. This affects the overall system performance. With the right scaling up of technology, businesses can become more flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain. By investing in latest technologies, businesses can improve performance with faster load time, create the best of UI/UX experience, reduced or almost nil downtime and manage higher workload.

Legacy systems need constant servicing to adapt to modern IT infrastructure when they aren’t updated. In addition, they require a lot of custom-code implementation to align with the latest tools and technologies. All this demands a huge investment of money and time which is not feasible to keep your business thriving and profitable. Hence, it’s important to modernize legacy applications to enhance their operations and ensure your business runs smoothly, free from the need to frequently resolve technological issues. Opting for modern applications and technology is the definite way forward to making your business & its applications more compatible and user friendly. Overcome Potential Security Threats Outdated systems have obsolete software that are more prone to security threats as they don’t get updated security patches from the developer. Hackers find it easy to access your network and steal your business data leading to a total disruption of your business strategy. It’s also difficult to recover these systems in case of a disaster.

Eliminates Hardware Dependency Running your business operations with the support of in-house hardware is no longer an efficient option. It’s time to move from on-premises to cloud for improved efficiency, minimised operational and infrastructure costs, and better application support. As mobility is becoming an integral part of the new operational model of most businesses, the need for mobile-friendly applications is increasing. Hence, continuing to rely on hardware could jeopardize your business in the long run. Legacy application modernization updates your software to make them mobile-friendly and ensures your employees connect easily to your inventory, management, or production software through their mobile devices to make data-driven decisions more effectively and quickly. Modernization Helps Deliver Improved User Experiences In today’s world where businesses offer similar products and services, it’s hard to differentiate oneself from competitors. However, one thing that helps you stand out amidst the crowd is the customer experience you provide. This will remain satisfactory if you stick to outdated technology that falls short to meet the evolving needs and expectations of the new-age customers. Modernization of legacy applications, though, can ensure your business delivers at par customer experience by using technology capable of providing solutions in alignment with their needs. This in turn helps your business satisfy your customers and retains them. Conclusion Apart from the above-mentioned significant factors, there are few other reasons on why businesses should shift their focus and make conscious decision of legacy app modernization. Businesses can avoid major disruptions since app modernization helps revamp operational model and enable smoother business operations. App modernization also focuses on making the platform user-friendly and makes it easy for modern infrastructure to be built. This allows efficient exchange of data between internal and external applications allowing businesses to perform better and thus profit better. Old and obsolete systems become a major hindrance in providing immersive experiences to your customers, scaling your business, and keeping your data safe. Not only do they demand excessive maintenance costing huge amounts of money, but they also need skillsets currently rare to find. Modernizing your legacy applications has become a priority of most organizations today as it solves the above-mentioned issues and helps them achieve their business goals faster and stay ahead in the competition. App Modernization is the key to innovation and helps change the face of business operation no matter the size of business.

Cloud security has become an important element of consideration. Today, more than ever, businesses and leaders need to address cloud security risks and misconfigured public cloud services. According to reports, a staggering 45% of data breaches originate in the cloud, highlighting the growing risk, and a concerning 69% of organizations have suffered data breaches or exposures due to vulnerabilities in their multi-cloud setups. These numbers make it clear that although businesses understand that cloud adoption brings numerous advantages to their business that they can’t afford to miss, they are also well-aware of the security concerns they can’t afford to ignore. Businesses and security leaders must have regular checkpoints with their cloud service providers on what measures are being taken periodically to prevent the risks hackers pose to your data. Here are 9 questions every senior executive should ask their cloud service provider to understand the security implications to which the provider must have the answers. 1.Is our cloud environment out of compliance? The fact that no organization using the cloud operates in an environment that’s completely in compliance with regulatory and security policies makes it important for you to know whether your environment is and isn’t in compliance. This is important for laying out a plan accordingly and bringing everything into compliance. Moreover, your security team should review internal enterprise security policies from time to time and see if your use cases are adequately addressed and new attack vectors are identified. Having a process to bring your environment into compliance is a must. 2.How many vulnerabilities did we identify and eliminate? Your cloud security should improve with time as your team becomes better at identifying and resolving security issues. For this, you need to have enough information about the existing misconfiguration vulnerabilities in your environment and the number of remediation per day. Thankfully, this process can be automated making your team’s work easier. Cloud security professionals with domain expertise can also help you understand the way major cloud breaches happen and help you create policy as code to check if your organization’s cloud infrastructure has the same conditions. 3.Did we prevent the deployment of any vulnerabilities? Discovering the vulnerabilities and restoring them isn’t enough. You must also know the steps taken by your security team to avoid such misconfigurations. In case you fail to resolve the issues, it would be hard to achieve business results with the same problems occurring again and again in different forms. So, here are some important considerations you must keep in mind. One, your team should have security built into continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines and should check infrastructure as code (a means of deploying cloud infrastructure programmatically) to find and fix misconfigurations pre-deployment, when safer and more efficient. If infrastructure as code and CI/CD pipelines have been adopted, make sure you have a plan to include security into these processes. 4.Where is my cloud data being stored? Is it secure? The server your data is stored on can be anywhere in the world. We all want to keep our information private. Hence, it’s essential for you to know where your data is stored and ensure that your organization follows regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. You should also know the simple ways to boost your data’s security beyond what’s built into systems used by your company. 5.What is the impact of security on productivity? When organizations adopt to cloud, their main goal is to make the digital transformation as efficient and smooth as possible in order to cultivate innovation and growth. However, security can become a major hindrance in achieving the desired outcomes in the expected time if application developers wait too long for building the infrastructure. Getting security reviewed and infrastructure approved by DevSecOps is also a time-consuming process. You have to measure the time being invested in these tasks and see how the process can be time efficient. The aim should be to invest more time in creating value for your customers and not in insufficient security processes affecting your team’s productivity. For this, have a security transformation strategy that allows you to respond and scale quickly to changes, increase resiliency, reduce costs, and deploy anywhere. 6.Do all teams have what they need to succeed? Modern business settings cannot operate without leadership that promotes collaboration and emphasizes teamwork. In order to best deal with security concerns, your organization must have an integrated approach that runs across all teams and cost centers. If the developers identify and fix some issues, this should be reflected in security investment on time the efforts will go to waste. What’s also important is to provide training to your employees on cloud security and solutions so that they have enough skills required to take responsibility for preventing security breaches. 7.How are we expressing security policies? Cloud security policies are either written and reviewed by people or maintained using policy as code. The former doesn’t make your cloud environments secure as breaches can happen in minutes while manually reviewing and enforcing policies take way more time. On the other hand, the policy as code provides accurate interpretation quickly making the process of evaluating cloud structure ultra-efficient. It is possible to express exceptions as code to ensure that everything is well documented when the application of a security policy changes from one deployment to another. 8.What will failure look like? In not so impossible scenario, you may experience a cloud breach hitting your company hard. The consequences of cloud breaches are severe. Past records prove that major breaches cannot just damage a company’s reputation, and cause customers to leave, but can even lead to its closure. It would be catastrophic to have a security breach in an age where data leaks are too sensitive a topic. So, what should you do to avoid dealing with such consequences? Implement a policy that asks for regular reporting about your company’s cloud security posture. Have all the answers to questions like how many vulnerabilities your existing infrastructure has, what steps are being taken to remediate them and how many are being eliminated every day. 9.Does my business have a solid data deletion plan in place? At some point, you may want to remove all your data from a cloud environment. You must therefore have a plan in advance that allows you to do this without any issues and ensure that the data is also removed from the cloud provider’s servers. This is necessary to avoid the chances of your data being accessed and misused. Conclusion Although the cloud comes with various benefits like greater scalability, more efficient workflow, and reduced IT costs, it also comes with the risks of your company’s data being exposed. While the existing demands of the market make cloud adoption indispensable, we surely can avoid major mishaps related to security by asking the above-mentioned 9 questions to our cloud service providers about security. Moreover, we must ensure that security is provided without having to deploy multiple tools and make separate decisions.

blog,Cloud – The Future of Digital Innovation,"Cloud – The Future of Digital Innovation Rayna Guha August 26, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Blog >> Cloud – The Future of Digital Innovation There are two important aspects of a business that ensure its sustainability apart from cost optimization. They are speed and resilience. So, what do you think helps companies to achieve them? Well, cloud computing is the answer every organization is turning to for making their businesses resilient and agile. That’s exactly what this blog will help us understand – the role of cloud computing in digital transformation, helping organizations achieve business resilience and making them future-proof. The Role of Cloud in Digital Transformation Digital transformation has become a priority for most businesses today, irrespective of their size, revenue, and business model. This is because operating optimally and meeting customer expectations requires the incorporation of the latest technologies into all areas of the business. Hence, failing to transform digitally has become equivalent to failing to deliver value to your customers. What enables this transformation also becomes a key component of a successful business- and that is where Cloud computing comes into picture. So, how does cloud exactly help? As we can see, the current market is changing at lightning speed and so are the ways in which the customers prefer the products or services delivered to them. This ever-evolving nature of the market makes digital transformation a necessity rather than a choice. The pandemic further accelerated the need to transform digitally if businesses wanted to keep afloat. Now digital transformation requires using the best apps, devices, storage and security to enable businesses to engage their customers more thoroughly. It also demands experimentation and speed without many risks involved which is where the cloud comes into the picture. Cloud has proved to be the most suitable option for enabling organizations to experiment as well as giving them the speed and resilience they need to have successful transformation journeys. Integration of the cloud seems to be the best way to go for projects as it not just provides speed, flexibility and resilience but also comes with data security-one of the biggest concern of organizations along with being one of the easiest to scale up or down as per business needs. Cloud also comes as a more economically viable option with a better ROI for these businesses which are time-bound and cost-bound. Factors Making Cloud the Future of Digital Innovation Single point of responsibility: As the IT infrastructure is growing more and more complex with time, especially in the FinTech Sector where businesses deal with sensitive data, maintaining the confidentiality and high availability becomes the focal point for these companies. Cloud helps simplify this complex landscape by being a single point of responsibility reducing maintenance costs and resources required to handle the complexities with superior technology that cloud offers. Cost-Efficiency: On-premises system calls for larger expenditure since it involves annual maintenance contracts resulting in large capital expenditure to maintain systems. Cloud on the other hand gives flexibility in terms of costing and comes with different models which the businesses can scale up or down as per requirement which makes it cost effective. Apart from this, cloud also offers maintenance and support as part of the monthly costs charged making it a viable option in the long run. By eliminating the upfront costs and providing the option of regular payments based on the services used, the cloud reduces expenses to a great extent. Saves Time: On-premises set up and implementation is time-consuming owing to multiple installations and server connections required for the set up to run smoothly. This will still demand for 24×7 on-site support with resources having to manage these servers. Implementation of cloud-based solutions takes place much faster than on-premises implementations. Deployments happens faster with cloud and can be made ready-to-use in matter of few hours or days. This makes it a preferable choice as organizations always prefer better and faster solutions. Boosts User Productivity: In today’s fast paced world, customers prefer having faster solutions, faster access over time-consuming ones. Cloud and many other SaaS applications today provide easy-to-follow user interface resulting in higher productivity. Although many businesses do try replicating the cloud experience with a host of workspace applications that allow single sign-on and provides access to unified set of applications, the proximity between user and data center needs to be in minimal distance resulting in user having to connect to VPN which brings about limited usability. Cloud computing on the other hand comes with features like ease of use, high performance, and accessibility making it the choice for many businesses. Offers Security and Data Recovery: Companies cannot afford to lose sensitive data at any cost. They also need to invest in disaster recovery to protect and keep their data safe. Both of which need huge investment and expertise. However, the cloud offers third-party expertise and reduces investment. Cloud-based solutions have also been proved to be trustworthy to most organizations making the decision to go for cloud-based solutions. Data loss is almost nil with periodical backups happening almost at real time. All it needs is a working internet connection. Most Cloud services company offers data recovery and security as part of cloud offering making it a cost-effective solution as well. Cloud computing is flexible: Cloud-based services are most suitable for businesses with fluctuating bandwidth demands as they are flexible and can be scaled up or down depending on the requirements. This flexibility helps businesses gain a competitive edge thus making cloud adoption obvious for companies who want to stay ahead of the competition. On-premises scaling requires more hardware provisioning, additional licensing, on the other hand with cloud it’s simplified with just upgrading for more cloud space and user access. Conclusion The shift from traditional ways to cloud technologies isn’t just the current trend but also the future scenario. And this shift, as discussed above has various reasons. Cloud computing enables supply chain optimization by providing infrastructure, platform, and software solutions, and thus leads to financial and operational benefits. Cloud makes the digital transformation journey seamless and cost-efficient by providing access to third-party networking and storage and many more benefits. In short, Cloud has become the key to digital innovation by proving to be the most reliable option for businesses who want to keep their data safe, run efficiently, make the most profits, perform optimally and gain a competitive edge by providing the best customer experience.

blog,The Difference Between Antivirus and Endpoint Security,"The Difference Between Antivirus and Endpoint Security Rayna Guha August 22, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Blog >> The Difference Between Antivirus and Endpoint Security Computers and software have changed the world. Who would believe that not too long ago we used to live and function without them. Today, the world seems unreal without them. The need to protect devices, users and data from malicious or unwanted software has increased tremendously with the accelerated inclusion of information technology, smart devices and the internet in our daily lives. According to statistics, 61% of organizations have faced a cloud security incident this year, and 21% of these incidents have led to data breaches. Data protection has been a topic of discussion in the world of IT for ages. But, today it has become essential as individuals and businesses become more dependent on the virtual world of the internet, and computers. In this blog, we will explore the difference between antivirus software and endpoint security. But, first, let’s understand what are these two and what features they offer. What is antivirus software? An antivirus is a security software used for the detection, prevention and removal of malware including Viruses, Trojans, Keyloggers, Ransomware, Worms etc. Malicious or unwanted software programs designed to harm a computer network or associated components are termed malware. Antivirus is the traditional security solution that is used as a standalone tool for the protection of devices such as a desktop, laptops, smartphones or servers. Antivirus software primarily runs the background and scans the devices regularly to detect malicious files or codes. Upon detection of an infected or suspicious file, it alerts the user of its presence. Today, antivirus software provides 360-degree protection and is used on an individual or home computers. It offers a few additional key features – Real-time plus manual scanning of the device Data protection on the web while using the internet Identification of numerous potential threats Isolation plus removal of malicious files Alerts and notifications upon scanning and updating the device Regular automatic update What is Endpoint security? Also referred to as Endpoint Protection Software, Endpoint security is a security measure that detects, protects and removes malicious network activities and cyber-attacks. Endpoint security is primarily used by end-user to safeguard their endpoint devices including servers, desktops, laptops, smartphones, workstations and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This security tool is used by businesses to ensure all-around protection of their endpoint devices. It offers a few additional key features – Detection and removal of vulnerabilities on endpoint devices Anti-malware data protection Investigation of the cause of the security breach Incident report and alert Implementation of measures to control malware spread Integration of numerous third-party security tools to enhance safety The Difference Similar yet poles apart are these two protection tools. Endpoint security can be referred to as the successor of its predecessor antivirus security software. Let’s take a look at some key differences between the capabilities of an antivirus and endpoint security software. Data Loss Apart from protecting data on endpoint pathways, Endpoint security also safeguards data stored on endpoint devices. It monitors data on every corporate endpoint, blocks unwanted traffic and alerts the IT security team of potential threats. However, it is important to include devices on the network where sensitive data is stored or moved. An antivirus can only protect the data of an individual or standalone computer system. Sandboxing One of the best features of an endpoint security tool is that it can analyse and evaluate malicious programs which antivirus can never do. Along with recognising, it prevents them from infecting the devices by removing and notification of the threat. Sandboxing is a feature in which an endpoint security tool creates an isolated yet secure digital environment that works similarly to a traditional operating system. The sandbox can run codes and analyse results without hampering any function of endpoint databases or servers. It allows the tool to identify the true nature of the program without damaging the actual workflow. An antivirus tool has no such capability. Firewall Security Endpoint security comes up with next-gen firewalls. Firewalls in endpoint protection software can monitor digital traffic flow, and analyse and block potential threats. It also works as a real-time monitoring security tool and can prevent data loss. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) EDR is another key feature of endpoint protection software. It allows users to monitor endpoint devices and databases internally for potential unwanted activities. It also notifies the security team of these threats. An antivirus comes up with the threat blocking ability while endpoint security can find the potential threat and safeguard devices from them. Integration The endpoint security tool allows integration of other security tools such as active directory, network monitoring, and security information & event management (SIEM) system to enhance security barriers. Antivirus software is an independent, standalone software that cannot be integrated with any other program. Reporting The endpoint security tool monitors all endpoint devices and catalogues an overall report of a potential threat on the network. It also can protect the endpoint network against several threats. An antivirus tool also reports security threats but of a standalone device. Conclusion Cybersecurity and data protection is of utmost importance today. Endpoint security software can be the solution for enterprises looking to safeguard their business and data from security threats. While antivirus software can be a traditional digital security barrier for standalone systems. Contact our cloud experts for a consultation!

It involves using different mediums, such as speech, writing, body language, and visual aids to convey messages effectively. Communication is a fundamental aspect of human interaction and crucial in all life aspects, including personal relationships, education, business, and politics. It can be utilized for various purposes, such as persuasion, education, entertainment, socialization, and problem-solving. Effective communication requires good listening skills, clarity, understanding of the audience, and the ability to convey messages appropriately and engagingly. In this blog we will understand the significance of communication between a business and its customers, along with various channels of communications. Role of Communication Between Business and Customer Communication is crucial in facilitating the relationship between a business and its customers. It helps businesses to connect with their customers, build trust, and understand their needs and expectations. Effective communication can lead to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and retention, which can ultimately contribute to the long-term success of a business. Here are some ways in which communication between a business and its customers is important: Building relationships: Communication helps to establish a personal connection between the business and the customer, making the customer feel valued and understood. This helps build a long-term relationship and increase customer loyalty. Understanding customer needs: Communication can help a business understand its customers’ needs and expectations, which can help it tailor its products and services to meet those needs more effectively. Providing Information: Communication can inform customers about the business, its products and services, and any changes or updates that may affect them. This helps keep customers informed and engaged. Addressing concerns: Communication can be used to address any concerns or issues that customers may have, providing them with a way to voice their opinions and get their questions answered and helping to build trust and increase customer satisfaction. Gathering feedback: Communication can be used to gather feedback from customers about their experiences with the business, which can help identify improvement areas and make necessary changes to serve their customers better. Effective communication between a business and its customers is essential for building a strong relationship, understanding customer needs, and providing excellent customer service. Multiple Communication Channels to Communicate with Customers Social Media: social media allows businesses to communicate with their customers in a more personal and engaging way. Using social media effectively, organizations can build relationships, provide helpful information, address concerns, and showcase their brand personality. Web Chat: Web chat is another way businesses can communicate with customers in real-time and provide a more personalized experience. By responding promptly, being friendly and personable, using a conversational tone, providing helpful information, and following up and following through, businesses can smoothly communicate with their customers on web chat. Chatbots: Chatbots can be a helpful tool for businesses to communicate with their customers, providing 24/7 availability, faster response times, personalized interactions, cost-effectiveness, and data collection capabilities. By using chatbots effectively, businesses can improve the customer experience and increase customer satisfaction. Messenger apps: Messenger apps provide businesses a convenient and efficient way to communicate with their customers, with real-time communication, personalization, multi-channel support, and improved customer engagement. By using messenger apps efficiently, businesses can improve the customer experience and build stronger customer relationships. Emails: Email is a widely used and valuable communication channel for businesses to follow up with customers. With timely follow-ups, personalization, automated responses, consistency, and tracking capabilities, email helps maintain the proper and legal flow of communication. Web forms: Web forms can be a helpful tool for businesses to keep in touch with their customers by collecting contact information, feedback, support requests, newsletter sign-ups, and leads. Businesses can use web forms consistently to improve the customer experience, build stronger customer relationships, and increase customer engagement. Traditional phone calls: Traditional phone calls remain popular for businesses to communicate with their customers. Phone calls can be a valuable tool for businesses to exchange ideas and thoughts with customers, along with a one-to-one interface, flexibility, immediate resolution, and clarification capabilities.

Physical appointments: Physical appointments can be a useful method for businesses to communicate with their customers more personalized and comprehensively. They can provide face-to-face interaction, in-depth communication, visual communication, problem-solving, and customer engagement capabilities. However, physical appointments can also have some drawbacks. They may require more time, resources, and planning than other forms of communication, which can be less efficient and more expensive. They may also be less convenient for customers with limited time or who live far away from the business location. Is It Important to Communicate With Customers On Various Multiple Channels? Communicating with customers on multiple channels is important as it can improve the customer experience and increase customer satisfaction. Many customers have different preferences regarding how they want to communicate with businesses. Some prefer email, while others prefer phone calls or social media. By offering multiple channels for communication, businesses can cater to these varying preferences and make it easier for customers to reach out to them in the way that they find most convenient. Moreover, having a presence on multiple channels can also increase the accessibility and availability of the business to its customers. For example, if a customer cannot get through on the phone, they may be able to reach out to the business through social media or email instead. By providing multiple communication channels, businesses can also improve their response times and reduce the chances of missing important customer messages or inquiries. This can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, positively affecting the business’s reputation and bottom line. Happy reading!

blog,The role of cloud consulting in enhancing customer experience,"The role of cloud consulting in enhancing customer experience Team Rapyder July 22, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Blog >> The role of cloud consulting in enhancing customer experience In the present digital landscape, customer experience (CX) reigns supreme. Customers today have unprecedented options at their fingertips. If they have a negative experience with your brand online, they can easily switch to a competitor with just a few clicks. Positive online reviews and recommendations from satisfied customers are powerful marketing tools in the present scenario. Businesses are constantly striving to create seamless, personalised and engaging interactions across all touchpoints. Here’s where cloud consulting steps in, acting as a powerful catalyst for crafting exceptional customer experiences by strategically utilising cloud technologies. The Cloud Consulting Steps: A Catalyst for Exceptional Customer Experiences Scalability and flexibility Cloud consulting ensures that businesses can scale their infrastructure to match the demand of their customers. So, even at the peak times, a business’s services and offerings remain smooth and responsive. This ensures that customers have a positive experience. For instance, consider an online retailer who anticipates a sudden surge in traffic during the Christmas shopping season. Thanks to strategic planning by cloud consultants, the retailer’s cloud infrastructure is designed to automatically adjust and allocate resources in response to increased traffic. Customers today expect a consistent brand experience across all channels – website, mobile app, social media and in-person interactions. Cloud consulting facilitates the integration of diverse systems, which help businesses to create a unified customer profile and deliver seamless omnichannel engagement. Take for example, a customer seamlessly switching between online research and in-store assistance. This has become much simpler because all their information is readily available across the different channels. Consultants are also highly adept at designing cloud solutions that can change with evolving needs of the business or the preferences of its customers. These adaptable solutions can be implemented quickly whenever necessary in the form of services and features. Data management and analytics Cloud consultants can use data analytics tools to provide deeper insights about customer preferences and behaviour. With such information, businesses are in a better place to tailor their communications and services to match customer expectations. Let’s take an example of a streaming service that uses cloud-based analytics tools set up by cloud consultants to analyse viewing patterns and preferences. This data allows the service to tailor recommendations for each user, suggesting shows and movies that align closely with their tastes. Improved reliability Cloud consultants build resilient systems that minimise downtime and ensure rapid recovery in case of disruptions. For example, consider the case of a restaurant that uses cloud-based systems for taking reservations, managing orders, and processing payments. A cloud consultant can ensure that the system is designed to withstand various disruptions, from minor technical glitches to major outages. The consultant can also implement a disaster recovery plan that includes regular backups of the restaurant’s data, such as menu information, customer details, and transaction histories. Agile development and innovation The cloud fosters rapid development cycles. Cloud consulting partners help businesses adopt agile development methodologies. This ensures that the business is able to quickly develop, test and iterate on new features and functionalities based on customer feedback. The increased agility is vital to stay ahead of the curve and deliver innovative solutions that meet evolving customer expectations. This is why around 96% of companies are now using at least one public cloud. Improving security Cloud consultants ensure that businesses adhere to strict data security and regulatory compliance standards. They help implement advanced security measures such as strong encryption for data storage and transfer, ensuring that sensitive customer information is protected from unauthorised access. For instance, for a health tech startup, cloud consultants ensure that all systems comply with specific regulations such as HIPAA. They conduct regular audits to identify security risks and assist in creating policies for handling and protecting customer data effectively. This not only builds customer trust but also enhances the overall customer experience. Strategic approach to cloud consulting While technology is critical, successful customer experience transformation requires a strategic approach. Here’s how cloud consulting partners act as more than just technology experts: Understanding customer journey: They collaborate with businesses to map the entire customer journey, while also identifying touchpoints and potential areas for improvement. Developing a customer experience strategy: They assist in crafting a tailored customer experience strategy aligned with the business’s goals and customer needs. This strategy outlines specific technologies, processes and KPIs for measuring success. Change management and adoption: Cloud consulting goes beyond just deploying technology. Partners help manage organisational change, which ensure employee buy-in and adoption of new cloud-based tools. It also helps to improve processes that specifically improve the customer experience.

blog,"Exploring Different Cloud Computing Models: Public, Private, and Hybrid","Exploring Different Cloud Computing Models: Public, Private, and Hybrid Saakshi jaiswal July 16, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Blog >> Exploring Different Cloud Computing Models: Public, Private, and Hybrid Cloud computing is a transformative force, revolutionizing how businesses manage their IT infrastructure and deliver services today. Understanding the various cloud computing models—public, private, and hybrid—is essential for organizations seeking to leverage the power of the cloud to drive innovation, agility, and scalability. This blog post aims to comprehensively explore the different cloud computing models: public, private, and hybrid. By delving into their definitions, characteristics, key features, benefits, use cases, and selection considerations, readers will gain valuable insights into choosing the right cloud model for their unique business requirements. What is Cloud Computing? Cloud computing delivers computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the internet (“the cloud”) on a pay-as-you-go basis. Rather than owning and maintaining physical hardware and infrastructure, organizations can access resources and services remotely from cloud service providers. It is defined as a paradigm that enables ubiquitous access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources, which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing: On-demand self-service: Users can provision computing resources as needed without human intervention from the service provider. Broad network access: Services are accessible over the internet via standard mechanisms, enabling ubiquitous access from any device. Resource pooling: Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple users, with dynamic allocation based on demand. Rapid elasticity: Resources can be rapidly scaled up or down to accommodate fluctuations in demand, allowing for agility and cost-efficiency. Measured service: Usage of cloud resources is monitored, controlled, and billed based on consumption, providing transparency and cost optimization. Now that we have a grasp of cloud computing, let’s explore the different computing models it offers. Public Cloud Computing Model: In the public cloud computing model, cloud services are provided by third-party vendors over the Internet, and resources are shared among multiple organizations. Public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offer a wide range of services, including computing, storage, networking, databases, and more. Key Features and Benefits: Scalability: Public cloud providers offer unlimited scalability virtually, allowing organizations to quickly scale resources up or down based on demand. Cost-effectiveness: Pay-as-you-go pricing models enable organizations to pay only for the resources they consume, reducing upfront capital expenses. Global reach: Public cloud providers operate data centers worldwide, enabling organizations to deploy applications and services closer to their users for improved performance and latency. Reliability and resilience: Public cloud providers offer high levels of reliability and redundancy, with built-in failover mechanisms and disaster recovery capabilities. Use Cases and Scenarios Where Public Cloud is Suitable: Web hosting and e-commerce Software as a Service (SaaS) applications Development and testing environments Big data analytics and machine learning Content delivery and media streaming Private Cloud Computing Model: In contrast to the public cloud, the private cloud computing model involves providing cloud services on dedicated infrastructure, either on-premises or in a hosted environment. Private cloud environments offer greater control, security, and customization than the public cloud. Key Features and Benefits: Enhanced security and compliance: Private clouds offer greater control over data security and regulatory compliance, making them suitable for industries with strict compliance requirements. Customization and flexibility: Organizations have full control over the configuration and management of their private cloud environment, allowing for customization to meet specific business needs. Performance and isolation: Private clouds provide dedicated resources and isolation from other users, ensuring consistent performance and minimizing the risk of noisy neighbour issues. Legacy application support: Private clouds can host legacy applications that may not be compatible with public cloud environments or require specialized hardware. Use Cases and Scenarios Where Private Cloud is Preferred: Highly regulated industries (e.g., healthcare, finance) Government agencies and public sector organizations Mission-critical workloads with stringent security requirements Legacy application modernization initiatives Hybrid Cloud Computing Model: The hybrid cloud computing model combines elements of both public and private clouds, allowing organizations to leverage the benefits of each while maintaining flexibility and control over their IT infrastructure. Hybrid cloud environments enable seamless integration and orchestration of workloads across multiple cloud platforms. Integration of Public and Private Clouds: Hybrid cloud environments enable organizations to dynamically move workloads between public and private clouds based on cost, performance, security, and compliance requirements. This flexibility allows organizations to optimize resource utilization and leverage the best of both worlds. Key Features and Benefits: Flexibility and scalability: Hybrid cloud environments offer the flexibility to scale resources up or down based on demand while maintaining control over sensitive data and workloads. Cost optimization: Organizations can leverage the public cloud’s cost-effectiveness for non-sensitive workloads while keeping critical data and applications on-premises or in a private cloud. Complexity and management overhead: Managing a hybrid cloud environment requires careful planning and coordination to ensure seamless integration, data consistency, and security across multiple platforms. Data governance and compliance: Organizations must establish policies and controls to govern data access, storage, and movement between public and private clouds to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. Use Cases and Scenarios Where Hybrid Cloud is Preferred: Hybrid cloud storage solutions (e.g., tiered storage, cloud backup and archiving) Cloud bursting for seasonal or unpredictable workloads Disaster recovery and business continuity planning DevOps and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines Considerations for Choosing a Cloud Model: Now that you understand the different cloud computing models, it’s essential to consider various factors when selecting a cloud model—be it public, private, or hybrid. Organizations should consider: Business requirements and objectives Data sensitivity and security considerations Regulatory compliance requirements Performance and scalability need Cost considerations and budget constraints Conclusion Rapyder, a premier cloud services provider, offers comprehensive solutions designed to simplify and optimize cloud computing for businesses of all sizes.

blog,Understanding Legal and Compliance Challenges in Cloud Computing,"Understanding Legal and Compliance Challenges in Cloud Computing Saakshi jaiswal June 21, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Blog >> Understanding Legal and Compliance Challenges in Cloud Computing In the world of cloud computing, regulatory compliance is a major concern for businesses. This blog will delve into the various regulatory and compliance issues in cloud computing business face and offer solutions for overcoming them. What is regulatory compliance? Regulatory compliance refers to adhering to laws, regulations, guidelines, and standards applicable to a particular industry or business. It involves ensuring that a company’s operations, policies, and procedures comply with the rules and regulations set forth by governing bodies. When it comes to cloud computing, regulatory compliance means that cloud service providers comply with legal and industry standards relating to the privacy, security, and accessibility of data. By adhering to these regulations, cloud providers operate within the limits of the law and ethical boundaries while providing cloud services to their customers. Regulatory compliance is a crucial aspect of cloud computing that assures clients of their data’s protection and privacy. What role does Cloud regulatory compliance play in businesses? Cloud regulatory compliance plays a vital role in businesses as it helps organizations operate securely and safely. Below are some key points that highlight the importance of regulatory compliance in cloud computing: Regulatory compliance in cloud computing ensures that organizations meet legal and industry standards relating to data privacy, security, and accessibility. This minimizes the risk of data breaches and ensures that organizations operate within legal and ethical boundaries. Cloud regulatory compliance is particularly critical in industries that handle sensitive data, such as healthcare, finance, and government. Compliance with regulations like HIPAA and PCI DSS ensures that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access and disclosure. Cloud providers like AWS and Azure have their own regulatory compliance standards, and businesses must ensure that their cloud service providers comply with these regulations. Incompetence to do so can result in legal and financial consequences. Compliance with cloud computing regulatory requirements can help businesses gain a competitive advantage by demonstrating their commitment to data privacy and security. Regular monitoring and auditing of cloud service providers can help businesses maintain compliance and reduce the risk of data breaches. Regulatory compliance issues in cloud computing Regulatory compliance issues in cloud computing arise from businesses entrusting their data to third-party cloud providers. Here are some common regulatory compliance issues in cloud computing: Data privacy: Many regulatory frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), require businesses to protect personal data privacy. In the Cloud, this can be challenging because the data is stored in a shared environment, and businesses must ensure that the cloud provider has adequate privacy controls in place. Data security: Data breaches in the Cloud can result in significant financial and reputational damage. Regulatory compliance requires businesses to implement adequate security controls to protect data in the Cloud. Data residency: Many regulations require businesses to store data in specific locations or jurisdictions. In the Cloud, data is often stored in multiple locations, making it challenging for businesses to ensure compliance with data residency requirements. Auditability: Many regulations require businesses to maintain audit trails and ensure data can be accessed and reviewed. In the Cloud, businesses must ensure that the cloud provider can provide the necessary audit trails and access controls. Compliance certifications: Many regulations require businesses to obtain specific certifications, such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, or HIPAA. In the Cloud, businesses must ensure that the cloud provider has these certifications or can provide the necessary compliance controls. Regulatory compliance issues in cloud computing require businesses to carefully consider their cloud provider’s capabilities and ensure they have the necessary controls to meet regulatory requirements. How to overcome Cloud regulatory compliance issues? Overcoming cloud regulatory and compliance issues can be a challenging task for businesses, but there are several steps that organizations can take to address these issues. Here are some ways to overcome regulatory and compliance issues in cloud computing: Understand the regulations: Businesses should ensure they understand the regulations that apply to their industry and the cloud service provider they use. This includes both regulatory requirements and industry standards. Select a compliant cloud service provider: Businesses should choose a cloud service provider that complies with the relevant regulations and has the necessary certifications and audits. Implement compliance controls: Organizations should implement controls to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, such as access controls, data encryption, and regular audits. For example, AWS and Azure comply with various regulatory requirements and have extensive compliance programs. Regularly monitor and assess compliance: Organizations should regularly monitor and assess compliance with regulations and industry standards to identify and address any compliance issues. Train employees: It’s essential to train employees on compliance policies and procedures to ensure that they understand their role in maintaining regulatory compliance. Businesses can overcome cloud regulatory compliance issues by understanding the regulations, selecting a compliant cloud service provider, implementing compliance controls, regularly monitoring compliance, and training employees on compliance policies and procedures.

case_study,"BlackBuck: 35% Cost Cut, Zero Performance Drop on AWS","BlackBuck: 35% Cost Cut, Zero Performance Drop on AWS Team Rapyder September 25, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> BlackBuck: 35% Cost Cut, Zero Performance Drop on AWS Client: BlackBuck Introduction: BlackBuck, founded in 2015, is a leading Indian trucking platform that revolutionized the industry by digitizing traditionally offline operations. Through its innovative technology, the company connects shippers with truckers, streamlining processes like load booking, payments, insurance, and financial services. By providing a reliable and efficient platform, BlackBuck aims to empower both shippers and truckers, ensuring timely and cost-effective transportation solutions. Business Need: BlackBuck seeks to migrate its QA environment from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to AWS Mumbai to consolidate its infrastructure and streamline its operations. This migration involves transferring numerous microservices, databases, and other services currently hosted on GCP virtual machines to AWS. By standardizing on AWS, BlackBuck aims to improve scalability, reliability, and performance while aligning its QA environment with its existing production infrastructure. Implementation: Rapyder’s engineers moved several databases and messaging services (Redis, Cassandra, Kafka, Maxwell, SonarQube, and MongoDB) from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to Amazon Web Services (AWS). They used a tool called MGN, AWS Application Migration Service, to make the transition easier. Rapyder’s engineering team successfully migrated heavy data of MySQL and PostgreSQL database from Google Cloud SQL to Amazon Web Services RDS, ensuring secure and efficient transfer of critical business information. Jenkins, a software tool, was set up on an AWS server (EC2) to help automatically deploy code changes to a Kubernetes cluster (EKS). The deployment process was broken down into different steps (stages) to make it easier to manage. This helped the team quickly and easily deploy the latest updates to their application. Industry: Transportation, Logistics, Supply Chain and Storage Offering: Migration AWS Services: EC2, RDS, MGN, EKS, IAM, Jenkins Reaping Rewards: BlackBuck’s IT team experienced a significant reduction in administrative overhead, allowing them to focus on more strategic tasks and optimize their AWS environment. BlackBuck’s AWS migration ensured accurate QA testing, leading to more reliable results and smoother deployments. They achieved a 35% cost reduction compared to their previous GCP setup while maintaining high resource utilization and efficiency, using AWS’s cost optimization tools. AWS’s robust security features and compliance certifications provided BlackBuck with peace of mind, ensuring that their QA environment met industry standards and protected their data. By identifying and resolving issues more quickly, BlackBuck was able to shorten their development cycles and bring new features and updates to market faster. Rapyder ensured a smooth disaster recovery planning and execution, with AWS environment which ensured their business could quickly recover from any disruptions. A single cloud platform fostered better collaboration between BlackBuck’s development, QA, and operations teams, leading to a more cohesive and efficient workflow.

case_study,RupeeRedee Achieved 5X Capability by Migrating to AWS Cloud Services,"RupeeRedee Achieved 5X Capability by Migrating to AWS Cloud Services Team Rapyder June 19, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> RupeeRedee Achieved 5X Capability by Migrating to AWS Cloud Services About The Client Since its inception in 2018, Gurugram-based fintech start-up RupeeRedee has provided instant small-ticket and flexible digital personal loans to the underserved population. It leverages state-of-the-art technology and data sciences to make lending safe and fast. The start-up’s customers include first-time borrowers who could not secure loans elsewhere, salaried, and self-employed. RupeeRedee has been expanding its operations rapidly and today its services in over 35 cities from just ten cities in 2018. Its services are available 24X7, thus beneficial during emergencies, which could be personal and business-related. The Business Need With the expansion of operations, the number of web and mobile applications increased, and the expected increase in demand and new opportunities required a much more robust technology infrastructure. Additionally, the intricate architecture, with the mixed-use of open-source and enterprise technologies, required a large-scale and robust cloud service that was scalable and secure! The existing service provider had the following challenges: performance issues, downtime issues, best practices being compromised, unable to address the need for redundancy, auto-scaling, and disaster recovery. Being prone to risks was inevitable as they were running on a public server. Moreover, there was a lack of monitoring and other support challenges from Rackspace too! RupeeRedee wanted to migrate its system to AWS for better availability and reliability. Earlier, they were leveraging Vyatta Gateway, where the firewall and VPN were being used by Rackspace, which had to be mapped and replicated from scratch upon migration as AWS did not support Vyatta. They were also looking at external security elements available with AWS to be included to improve overall security. The organization was looking for a partner with AWS expertise to help develop its complete infrastructure, including 40+ cloud servers to AWS cloud. They were also looking at external security elements to be included to improve overall security. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with expertise and experience in successful cloud migration services, was chosen by the client to help migrate to AWS Cloud. The Solution Rapyder’s team of Cloud Architects had several online assessments (due to social distancing and lockdown) and discovery sessions with the client’s infrastructure and DevOps teams to understand the latter’s requirement for migration to AWS Cloud. The team then conceptualized and created a robust and customized solution around AWS services for the migration. The following proposed solution was implemented by Rapyder for a successful migration to AWS while ensuring that the best practices and business continuity principles are also applied. Amazon EC2 was leveraged as it provided resizable compute capacity in the AWS cloud. By offering IaaS, it also provided complete control of computing resources, which could be scaled as per requirement. AWS IAM was used to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Microsoft SQL Servers, their primary database management system, which they were running, was migrated in negligible downtime. Amazon Aurora, which Amazon RDS fully manages, was leveraged. This provides security, reliability, and high availability. Amazon RDS automates time-consuming administrative tasks too. Security was a critical factor being a fintech solution platform. AWS WAF was used to help protect web applications or APIs against attacks that could impact availability and security while consuming excessive resources. Amazon CloudWatch was used to monitor the applications and alerts in case of any changes in resource utilization or unhealthy servers, wherein timely action could be taken. The Benefits This migration to AWS cloud has brought several benefits to RupeeRedee platform. There was a significant improvement in handling a higher number of customer traffic, 500% more! Scalability was established for any future requirements. A significant reduction in costs was observed despite higher volumes of traffic. Savings of up to 30 percent with a few more optimizations is expected with the migration. The new program’s free AWS credits were an additional bonus. The response time on the website and the app is much faster, with fewer downtimes. There has been an overall improvement in user experience too. All earlier manual interventions, such as regular backups, fault tolerance, and mirroring, have been automated with this transition.

Square Panda’s adaptive platform helps children globally, across skill sets and socio-economic backgrounds, to equip themselves with reading, writing, and communicative skills. The learning experience is joyful and based on innovative teaching practices. The Business Need The applications were already hosted on AWS in the US. However, with the new setup in India, SquarePanda wanted to expand its operations in India and China and implement the hosting of applications on AWS in these new geographical locations. The client wanted to address the business need for a faster go-to-market facility and deliver an enhanced customer experience that would be brought about with this implementation. It was looking for a partner who could provide them with an AWS solution for their application and ensure scalability, high availability, and security. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with extensive experience and competency in successful cloud migration and implementation services, was chosen and partnered with. This led to the Customer looking for a solution that would improve its delivery and support of IT while lowering the total cost of ownership. The Solution To effectively address the business need of the Client, Rapyder’s team of Cloud Architects thoroughly studied the former’s requirement for implementation. A customized solution around AWS services was implemented while applying Cloud Deployment Architecture best practices and business continuity principles. Rapyder implemented the following proposed solution and architecture approach: In the new AWS infrastructure, all the servers were launched in private subnets for ease of administration and control, with most components deployed in multi-AZ configuration to avoid single-point failure. AWS-managed load balancer was used to balance the traffic across two availability zones. The balancer was configured to route all site traffic, including dynamic pages. AWS-managed NAT Gateway was used for any outbound traffic from servers in private subnets. Monitoring and alerts were set up on each server to monitor metrics like CPU, memory, and disk. Cloudtrail was enabled for all regions. CI/CD pipelines were set up for each application component, where AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy were used. The Benefits Time-to-market was significantly reduced by 30%, with high agility achieved. The new infrastructure was up and running in two weeks. No single point of failure was witnessed as the environment was running in high availability behind the load balancer.

case_study,Rapyder Empowers Stellaps with a Cutting-Edge Gen-AI Powered Multilingual Chatbot!,"Rapyder Empowers Stellaps with a Cutting-Edge Gen-AI Powered Multilingual Chatbot! Team Rapyder May 7, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Rapyder Empowers Stellaps with a Cutting-Edge Gen-AI Powered Multilingual Chatbot! Introduction: In today’s competitive business landscape, providing exceptional customer service is no longer optional – it’s essential. Stellapps stands out as the first of its kind startup in India, dedicated to the digitization of the dairy supply chain. Founded in 2011, it is an IIT Madras incubated, Bangalore based, Internet of Things (IoT) startup with a primary focus on data acquisition and machine learning. Milk, being the largest crop on this planet, highlights a strong demand for technology interventions, particularly in emerging markets where the yield per animal is low, traceability is inadequate, and quality is not up to the mark. Digitization of the Agri-Dairy supply chain in emerging markets is the area where Stellapps aids in unlocking unprecedented value on a very large scale. Industry: Dairy Offering: Gen AI Business Need: StellApps has an application the caters to farmers from rural India. The application helps farmers to get the detail for the farming related queries. Currently the existing application is not able to handle the native language features and sharing response only in English. As a result of this end-user of the application are not getting the desired benefit from this application. The StellApps team wants to enhance the application by introducing a feature that allows users to record audio questions in their native language. These questions relate to topics such as taking care of cattle, managing/handling the crops etc. In response, the application should provide response in the farmer’s local language with correct and accurate details. Implementation: Rapyder has proposed a solution powered by GenAI capabilities. We proposed solution using AWS Bedrock to answer the query from the existing documents. We are taking RAG based approach using Amazon RDS PostgreSQL as Vector DB and Amazon S3 as raw storage. We are creating a data pipeline by using services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon ECS with Fargate, AWS ECR and Amazon API Gateway to keep the data updated. To build the GenAI based solution for the use case, there are two major activities that we need to address as part of the solution: Build Knowledge base for chatbot using PDF document Build the chat API that understands the user query and provide the accurate response Farmers or villagers, the primary users, can ask questions in their local language by recording their voices. The audio is then translated to English using the Whisper API hosted on ECS Fargate. The translated text is used to search PGVector, extracting relevant information from documents. This information, along with RAG based approach using Bedrock, generates responses in English text. Stellapps own application uses the transcript from our solution to create the output in native farmers source language. Solution Architecture: The core of our GenAI solution is a microservices-based architecture deployed on the AWS cloud. This architecture provides scalability, flexibility, and resilience, ensuring that the chatbot can meet the demands of Stellapps. Component: Knowledge Base pipeline: As per AWS best practices, we have kept raw data in S3 bucket. An AWS Lambda event will be triggered to pre-process the uploaded data. We are performing the embedding using Amazon Bedrock Titan model on the raw data, and ingesting the embeddings into Amazon RDS PGVector DB. GenAI Activity: We have created Whisper ECS API that accepts audio, and performs the transcription, and parse transcription to LLM API. We are converting the English input text into embeddings using Amazon Bedrock Titan model. We have implemented the data retrieval on VectorDB using similarity search algorithm using Langchain based approach. Response is getting created by using Claude2 model with help of Langchain based RAG pipeline using refined prompts after getting input from the StellApps team. As part of best practices, if the context or answer is not available for the given query chatbot is politely asking the end-user to connect with customer care and relevant field expert doctors. LLM based tuning & improvement: Used chunking for the knowledge-based data while embedding data into PGVector. Experimented different “K” values while setting up RAG pipeline to get the better results while performing similarity for the query. Performed parameter tuning for TopP, token length and temperature control for getting the good accuracy. Added prompt engineering best practices and ensured that no false information is being provided as response and input is added to get the information vetted from the doctor or field experts. AWS Services: Amazon S3 Amazon RDS Amazon ECS with Fargate AWS ECR Amazon API Gateway AWS Lambda AWS Bedrock Reaping Rewards: Added feature to handle Indian languages with higher accuracy, this will help to get a larger Indian user-base. Customer is currently serving more than 100K farmers who are set to get benefitted from this solution. Reduced effort and maintenance cost for Knowledge base pipeline. Multi-lingual chatbot helped the business acquire more users and create more penetration across multiple geographical location serving with more than 15 languages across India. Customer is already acquired 17% new customer and growing As for many issue users were earlier visiting veterinary doctor, facing waiting time resulting in unsatisfactory outcome and spending cost for trivial issues. With this solution Customer team received positive feedback and appreciation for the integration and cost saved for the end-user.

case_study,Revolutionizing user experience with Gen-AI powered chatbot,"Revolutionizing user experience with Gen-AI powered chatbot Team Rapyder May 2, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Revolutionizing user experience with Gen-AI powered chatbot Introduction: Fibe has consistently aimed at serving young professionals, a group often overlooked by traditional financial institutions. Since its inception, Fibe has processed over a million loans and has been pivotal in simplifying access to financial services, making it a beloved tool for mid-income individuals across India. Fibe, hereafter referred to as “Customer”. Industry: Fintech Offering: Gen AI Business Need: Customer was using traditional dialogue driven chatbot to answer the loan related queries. The queries range from simple FAQ to customer specific questions related to payment due dates etc. Because the customer was using dialogue driven approach, lots of questions from end users were restricted to receive answers only for predefined questions. This caused an increase in the number of calls to their call center which in turn increased the operational cost. The customer was looking for a context based free flow chatbot to interact with the end users. Implementation: To address the identified shortcomings and enhance the chatbot’s capabilities, a GenAI-based solution is proposed. This solution will integrate several key features to ensure improved performance and adaptability: Knowledge Base Management: Develop a centralized system to manage FAQ sheets, APIs, and other business documents, streamlining information access and updates. Contextually Relevant Responses: Utilize advanced LLMs to generate tailored responses based on user queries, enhancing accuracy and usefulness. Free-flow Human-like Conversation: Leverage existing data for the chatbot to engage in natural, personalized conversations with users, improving user experience Integrate RAG System: Incorporate a Retrieval Augmentation & Generation system to dynamically retrieve real-time data, enriching chatbot responses with up-to-date information. Handling Dynamic and Static Queries: Equip the chatbot to effectively handle both real-time and static inquiries, ensuring timely and accurate responses to user queries. AWS Deployment Architecture: Implementation Strategies and Enhancements: 1. Chat Pipeline: Platform Evolution: The chatbot journey commenced with Amazon Bedrock Claude 2 and evolved to Amazon Bedrock Claude Instant 2.1 for expedited response times. Contextual Enrichment: Amazon Bedrock Titan was instrumental in embedding the FAQ sheet, augmenting responses with contextual understanding. Data Management and Authentication: Amazon DynamoDB facilitated data storage for session management and contextualization of user queries. The chatbot adeptly managed two distinct user personas: guest users and registered customers, with authentication handled via backend APIs using CustomerID. 2. Data Pipeline: FAQ Management: A robust data pipeline was established to manage FAQs stored on Vector DB deployed on Amazon EKS, ensuring continuous updates without disrupting chatbot functionality. Customer API Integration: Another pipeline was created to interact with Customer APIs, retrieving crucial details such as payment dates and due dates specific to a user. LLM-based Key Work and Improvements: Model Enhancement: The switch from Claude 2.1 to Claude Instant significantly improved response times, enhancing overall user experience. Parameter Tuning and Refinement: Parameter tuning and the addition of XML tags and placeholders within prompts refined response generation, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant answers. Custom Logic Implementation: A bespoke logic was developed to enable agents to discern whether a query should be addressed through FAQ or necessitated a customer API call, resulting in optimized response times. Admin Control Options: Administrators were provided with parameter tuning options through API headers, granting control over parameters such as Top P, token length, and temperature for tailored chatbot responses. This chatbot is designed to answer queries related to fintech and based on the knowledge base vector DB. We have implemented custom guardrails approach to handle situation where end-users were asking irrelevant questions, example: How to make a lemonade?, Who is the Prime Minister of India etc. We have implemented few shot prompting to make the response more appealing to the customer that ensures that response is polite and graceful and does not add statements such as “based on context”, “based on API response” in the final outcome. Implemented Vectorization method while storing the data in VectorDB to ensure smooth and faster data retrieval. We have also enabled ranking and filtering based on similarity threshold values and metadata stored in VectorDB. AWS Services: Amazon S3 Amazon Bedrock Amazon API Gateway AWS Lambda Amazon DynamoDB Amazon EKS Amazon VPC Amazon EC2 Amazon ECR Reaping Rewards: With rapid response generation clocking in at an impressive 2-3 seconds, users experienced minimal wait times, significantly enhancing overall user experience. Fibe chatbot is now handling more than 4 lakh conversation and over 5 Million user base, having ~10 messages on average per conversation. This chatbot has streamlined and automated 95% of the agent based chat for dynamic queries. The enhanced chatbot with its accurate responses for the end users, resulted in 15% reduction in the number of agent conversation made to the agents than before, hence contributing to saving operational cost close to 200K USD. Implementation ensured better maintenance of the knowledge base and an easy-to-update pipeline, further optimizing resource utilization, and reducing operational overheads for the customer.

case_study,Neogrowth Significant Increase in Performance & Cost Savings With AWS,"Neogrowth Significant Increase in Performance & Cost Savings With AWS Team Rapyder March 11, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Neogrowth Significant Increase in Performance & Cost Savings With AWS The Client Founded in 2012 and an ISO 9001:2015 certified player in the SME digital lending space, NeoGrowth is a Mumbai-based platform with a PAN India presence. Registered with the RBI, the organization’s approach includes innovative technology, a digital payment ecosystem, and flexible payment options. This fintech case study about NeoGrowth’s mission is to have a positive social impact on the ﬁnancial lives of SMEs by leveraging the digital payments ecosystem. With over 1,000 employees across 29 branches along with 2000+ channel partners, and over 17,000 customers, NeoGrowth serves industries such as F & B, hospitality, healthcare and pharma, automobile, and apparel. Digital Lending The MSME sector certainly has high growth potential, but securing funds from banks to fuel its growth has always been challenging. With banks demanding collaterals and imposing several restrictions, SMEs could not run smoothly. However, in the recent past, with technological advancements, several ﬁntech organizations are encouraging new entrepreneurs in the sector by enabling easy access to ﬁnance with digital lending platforms. NeoGrowth is one such platform striving to bridge the credit gap of MSMEs and offers customized products to address multiple business needs of customers. More than before, with Covid 19 pandemic, SMEs are playing a bigger role in the nation’s economic growth, and platforms such as NeoGrowth are also seeing an increase in demand for their services. Business Need As customers increased, efﬁciency, scalability, and continuous delivery became priorities driving NeoGrowth to adopt the scalability of microservices architecture along with container orchestration. This would support its developers to bring their applications from the development to the production stage at record speed and provide scalability and ﬂexibility of their applications. As an existing customer of Rapyder Cloud Solutions for managing its applications on the cloud AWS cloud platform, NeoGrowth, however, was still running microservices on a couple of static servers where-in each task demanded varying amounts of memory and CPU, leading to performance inefﬁciencies. In the absence of accurate resource allocation, the limitation in the memory would negatively impact the entire application, leading to service delays. To address this challenge, NeoGrowth consulted Rapyder’s engineers to move to microservices-based architecture and container orchestration with AWS ECS. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with expertise and experience in successful cloud migration and managed services, completed the transition and deployment of container orchestration. The Solution Covid-19 has undoubtedly accelerated cloud adoption by several years. Companies are increasingly leveraging container technology to fast-track application development, deployment, and portability of apps across different platform infrastructures. Rapyder’s expert team of Cloud Architects conceptualized and stitched a powerful and customized solution around Amazon Web Services for the task. Rapyder’s team supported the smooth transition to the successful deployment of microservices-based architecture and AWS ECS enablement. The team ﬁrst made the shift to containerize the microservices architecture at NeoGrowth. Unlike the traditional static server deployment, with the application’s components and functions in a single instance, microservices architecture splits the application into multiple services that perform different functions, each with a different logical function. These microservices were then placed in containers. Container orchestration leverages tools and platforms to automate, manage and schedule workloads that are deﬁned by individual containers. Containerization of the application was then done, followed by container orchestration with the Amazon ECS platform to manage the entire life cycle. This container orchestration is supported in automating the scheduling, deployment, scaling, and overall management of containers across a ﬂeet of servers. Amazon ECS, being highly scalable with high performance, allowed developers to run effortlessly, scale containerized applications, and automatically reschedule containers if required. Rapyder’s team also supported the client in leveraging spot instances with AWS services, in an economically priced model with steep discount offers, for test and development. The Benefits Building and delivering software reliably are key to an organization’s success and positive business outcomes in a digital economy. Equally important is the visibility across and within the software coding and delivery processes to ensure high speed and scalability with demand. The transition to microservices-based architecture did not impact the running of the business. Developers could now work faster due to smaller code bases in microservices with lesser complexities and dependencies of functions, bringing about better operational efﬁciency. Code reviews and updates were done faster, and failures could be isolated without bringing the entire system. Moreover, developers could leverage different programming languages effortlessly. All these led to continuous delivery, thereby establishing higher productivity. Scalability was independent of each microservice where only the required component of an app could be This ensured optimization of resources making the whole process cost-efﬁcient. Leveraging spot instances that came with AWS economically priced model also helped in cost- optimization to a large Above all, the ease of use of Amazon ECS in itself was beneﬁcial.

Applications are developed in a multi-tier architecture with the following technology stack: Application Front End: Laravel CMS: Symphony API Server: Node.js Database: MySQL Customer is intending to migrate to the AWS Mumbai Region. Being a critical website, the customer also wanted a highly available, scalable, and resilient architecture to be implemented, keeping AWS best practices in mind. Below were the requirements from the customer: By moving the infrastructure closer to the target audience in India, the customer aims to reduce latency and enhance the website’s performance. The challenge lies in ensuring a seamless migration without any disruption to end users. Customer wanted to have highly reliable and scalable Infrastructure at AWS. Customer also wanted to ensure that high availability was maintained for every component of the infrastructure.

In the discovery, we also captured information about the size of the data to be migrated and affordable downtime. AWS best practices and business continuity principles were applied and followed through the implementation, as explained below. Based on discussion and considering the target audience location, the Rapyder team recommended the customer migrate the Infrastructure to the AWS Mumbai Region. This will reduce the latency that customers are facing and also improve the performance of the application. Considering the Application’s criticality and as a frontend application, API and Symphony CMS applications were supporting horizontal scaling, deployed in an auto-scaling Group spanning across Multiple Availability zones, making Infra highly available. RDS Aurora MySQL is also deployed in MultiAZ mode, providing Automatic failover with data redundancy. High availability requirements were ensured by incorporating AWS services, which support High availability and are deployed across multiple Availability zones in the Mumbai region. Well defined DevOps pipelines were created to automate Application deployments using AWS native DevOps services. To optimise the overall monthly AWS Cost, Rapyder proposed implementing AWS services like AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets. By studying the Resource utilisations, Rapyder proposed to right-size the infrastructure and opt for a Reserved Instance/Savings Plan. Reaping Rewards: With this solution, we provided customers with a Secure, reliable, and Scalable Infrastructure on AWS, offering High Availability. The customer is experiencing an impressive uptime of more than 99.95% with our resilient architecture. This includes a highly reliable infrastructure, minimized downtime, and ensuring the application’s availability at an exceptional level. Implementing Applications into Autoscaling Groups helps manage the fluctuating demand for Resources. Moving the application to the AWS Mumbai Region improved the application’s performance and reduced the Latency issues. With the DevOps pipelines, the risk of manual errors was completely removed.

case_study,Limechat Migrated Its Applications from AZURE to AWS,"Limechat Migrated Its Applications from AZURE to AWS Team Rapyder April 1, 2022 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Limechat Migrated Its Applications from AZURE to AWS Introduction: LimeChat is India’s first level-3 AI chatbot company. LimeChat’s focus on e-commerce internet-first brands increases online sales and conversions and reduces customer support costs by 50%. LimeChat’s smart chatbot offers customers personalized and contextual conversational experiences wherever they are in the buyer’s journey. With integrations across CRM software, store management platform, payments network, and logistics platforms, LimeChat take great care of customer interactions for its clients. Business Need: The Limechat hosted a helpdesk solution for customer support and Chatbot logic on Kubernetes Cluster on the Microsoft Azure Platform. However, it faced challenges in ongoing support while running on Azure and wanted to migrate the application to AWS Cloud for better Support and Manageability. Below were the requirements from Limechat A Separate isolated and secure environment is to be created on the AWS cloud. Earlier, Limechat hosted their Application on Kubernetes at Azure and wanted to use the same Kubernetes platform on AWS. Limechat wanted to have secure, reliable, and scalable Infrastructure at AWS. At Azure, Limechat was using Instances with small configurations for PostgreSQL and Redis as they had separate PostgreSQL and Redis Databases for every end customer. At AWS, it needed a single PostgreSQL and Redis Database with a powerful configuration. It was looking forward to seamless migration with no data loss and with very minimal downtime. Limechat wanted to use AWS-managed services wherever possible. Implementation To address the objectives defined Business Need section, Rapyder worked with Limechat and came up with AWS Cloud Deployment Architecture for implementation. As Limechat was using Kubernetes on Azure, it recommended using AWS Managed Orchestration Service – Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). We applied the AWS best practices and business continuity principles and followed through the implementation as explained below: Considering end-customer demographic locations, AWS Mumbai Region was selected. A separate network with a combination of VPC/ Subnets was created as per AWS best practices. All the servers and Databases were hosted in a private subnet, thus eliminating direct access to the application, resulting in additional application security. AWS Managed Kubernetes Service – AWS EKS was used to host containerized microservice-based Applications. Scalability is considered at both levels, i.e., at the Worker node level (auto-scaling group) and POD level. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL is implemented in MultiAZ for High availability. For Data Security, encryption is considered. In Transit: using Lets Encrypt SSL At Rest: EBS and S3 Data encryption using AWS KMS AWS managed Service – Elasticache for Redis was implemented as an in-memory Database. AWS Services: AWS Managed Kubernetes Service – Amazon EKS, Application Load Balancer (ALB), NAT Gateway, Amazon RDS PostgreSQL, Amazon Elasticache for Redis, Amazon Cloudwatch, Amazon SNS, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon S3, IAM, AWS Config, AWS KMS. Third-Party Solution None Reaping Rewards: With this solution, we provided a Secure, Reliable, and Scalable Infrastructure on AWS EKS, offering High Availability. With the Rapyder team’s assistance, Limechat could Migrate to AWS Cloud with minimal downtime and zero data loss. Enterprise-grade RDS PostgreSQL in MultiAZ provides the expected performance. AWS managed Elasticache for Redis in high availability and boosted customer application performance by providing sub-millisecond response time. Using AWS Managed Services like RDS and Elasticache for Redis also released Infrastructure Management overhead from Limechat’s shoulders.

case_study,Biryani by Kilo’s Achieved Incredible ROI & Customer Experience Migration To AWS Cloud,"Biryani by Kilo’s Achieved Incredible ROI & Customer Experience Migration To AWS Cloud Team Rapyder March 21, 2022 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Biryani by Kilo’s Achieved Incredible ROI & Customer Experience Migration To AWS Cloud About the client Gurugram-based food-tech start-up, Biryani by Kilo (BBK), launched in 2015, has today expanded its reach across 30 cities in India with around 70 outlets and continues to grow exponentially. It offers Biryani to the masses and uses the best ingredients, including expensive branded rice, spices handpicked from Kerala, and stringently selected meats and vegetables for its Biryani and Kebabs. This cloud-kitchen start-up aims to grow to 200 plus outlets across India in the next two years and expand to international destinations, with an estimated Rs. 500 crore annual revenue by then. Client’s challenge and the business need BBK’s fast growth is driven by its increasing number of customers and expanding footprint. Although the organization had migrated to AWS Cloud from running on a Private Cloud, it faced several operations and customer service challenges. In addition, due to the inaccurate configuration of the AWS Cloud architecture, BBK’s business-critical infrastructure was impacted. Customers’ orders from food aggregators such as Zomato and Swiggy were getting missed at the outlets due to intermittent server outages, thereby losing crucial business and spoiling the customer’s experience. This challenge worsened when there was a significant spike in order volume during weekends, holidays, and special days, such as Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve. Database optimization was another area that had to be addressed. Cloud Security was another area that needed to be addressed, as the organization was using payment gateways for food orders. High availability and scaling of cloud infrastructure were required, without which the business functions could suffer. The client was unhappy with their AWS partner and was looking for a more experienced partner who could help them derive the proper benefits of AWS and help solve their issues. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with expertise and experience in successful cloud migration services, proposed a new solution to address all the above challenges. Rapyder’s team of Cloud Architects had several discovery sessions with the client to understand the latter’s requirement for implementing AWS Cloud. Then, they conceptualized and stitched a powerful, robust, and customized solution around AWS services for the task. Rapyder implemented the following proposed solution for a successful implementation of AWS Cloud. Rapyder re-configured the cloud architecture and ensured successful migration to the re-architected AWS cloud environment to suit the growing requirements of the organization. Being content heavy with videos and pictures of the dishes, these files were stored and continuously running across the network. They could be accessed by mobile phones even in Tier 2 cities from a 2G network too. AWS CloudFront was leveraged to deliver content continuously across all networks and geographies. Downtime challenges was addressed to contain business and customer losses, with all orders to the organization across touchpoints getting executed. Overall security of the infrastructure, covering payment gateways and all other security parameters, such as information and data security, was achieved. CloudWatch was leveraged to monitor the infrastructure, and proactive measures were taken to address issues. Database optimization was established with all DB layer parameters put in place. Availability and Scalability aspects were established in this new-architected infrastructure. All Applications and Databases were migrated to AWS cloud during non-peak hours with minimum downtime not affecting business operations. The entire solution that was stitched and implemented met the criteria of Security best practices. Business benefits With the significant reduction in downtime, the high volume of food orders placed was attended to and served, increasing business and ROI. Content delivery through videos was achieved, leading to smooth business transactions across all outlets in Tier I and Tier 2 cities and from 2G, 3G, or 4G networks, thereby enhancing customer experience. Cloud Infrastructure performance improved as a highly available and scalable architecture was provided at all the layers with the deployment. Employing AWS services such as self-managed EC2 instances and leveraging auto-scaling observed significant cost savings. Ease of management of applications and optimal performance was achieved with the migration. The migration of applications and databases was completed with negligible downtime with no impact on the business. Currently, the Cloud Infrastructure is maintained 24X7 by Rapyder, with BBK also signing up for the Managed Services. QUOTE: This biryani startup case study appreciating the effort Rapyder team, Kaushik Roy, Head of BBK, said, “The Rapyder team of Cloud experts was able to zero down on the several issues present in the old Cloud Architecture to create a stable and secure environment. Now, we can provide a better customer experience, where orders are not missed with a faster turn-around time of service delivery being achieved as well.” He added, “We have also signed up for Rapyder’s ongoing Managed Services to monitor and manage the Cloud Infrastructure.” Case Studies Download Case Studies Share Search Case Studies Recent Case Studies NIMF Achieves 50% Cost Savings with Saasification of Their Desktop Application January 17, 2025 Rapyder Enabled 100x Engineers to Successfully Implement Automation on AWS Cloud with a Modern Infrastructure Approach December 16, 2024 Rapyder’s Chatbot Resolves 95% of Queries with Ease and Precision November 18, 2024 Categories Migration Pinpoint Modernization Managed Services Gen-AI End-User Computing DevOps Database Migration Data Analytics/Machine Learning All Categories Articles Blogs Case Studies Cloud Optimization Cloud Security Cost Optimization Resources Data Analytics/Machine Learning Database Migration DevOps End-User Computing Events Gen-AI Managed Services Migration Modernization Pinpoint Tags All Tags AWS Ecommerce/Retail EdTech Financial Services FinTech Healthcare IoT IT/ITES Manufacturing Media & Entertainment Travel/Visa Firm Subscribe to the latest insights Subscribe to the latest insights Email Submit PrevPrevious NextNext Related Case Studies NIMF Achieves 50% Cost Savings with Saasification of Their Desktop Application Read More Rapyder Enabled 100x Engineers to Successfully Implement Automation on AWS Cloud with a Modern Infrastructure Approach Read More Rapyder’s Chatbot Resolves 95% of Queries with Ease and Precision Read More By Team Rapyder Get in Touch!

case_study,Trilasoft Migrate from AWS N. Virginia to European Region,"Trilasoft Migrate from AWS N. Virginia to European Region Team Rapyder March 15, 2022 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Trilasoft Migrate from AWS N. Virginia to European Region About Client: Trilasoft, Founded in 2007, Trilasoft works passionately to bring ideas to life and create applications for start-ups and enterprises. The company offers its customers a unique value proposition to meet their transformation and innovation challenges. Trilasoft supports its customers through the entire development lifecycle, from conceptualization and designing to implementation and ongoing maintenance, to ensure products and services meet the requirements of tomorrow. Customer Business Need: The customer is expanding its operations in European Region, and to operate in that region, it had to comply with regional GDPR rules. Hence they would like to migrate their Application & Infrastructure from the AWS N—Virginia region to AWS European Region. Below were the requirements from the customer: A separate isolated and secure environment in the European AWS region to develop applications for their end customers. Ensure no data is lost during migration from one region to another, and their integrity & accuracy should be maintained. The entire migration activity should complete within the least possible downtime. A highly reliable and durable solution to store their data & keep it safe from theft or loss. Make use of AWS-managed services for database and filesystem services. A centralized identity management system is in place to track & manage access smoothly. Solution: Our AWS Certified Solutions Architects conducted detailed workshop sessions with the customer to understand their existing setup, challenges, and migration requirements. In the discovery, we also captured information about the data size to be migrated and affordable downtime. Following the solution, an approach was proposed and implemented with best practices, and then migrate their production workload to AWS; A separate network with a combination of VPC/Subnets was created as per the best practices. All the servers and databases will be in a private subnet to match their current architecture. The “Backup & Restore method” was adapted to migrate EC2 instances and RDS instances from N—Virginia Region to the Stockholm region. DataSync was used to transfer data from one region to another. AWS WAF was set up to protect AWS resources from SQL injection, cross-scripting, and DDoS attacks. Application auto-scaling is configured to scale our EC2 instances as needed during sudden growth in the user request. A read replica of RDS was set up to improve read performance from the database. AWS Services: AWS WAF, ALB, NAT, EC2, RDS, EFS, S3, CloudTrail, Glue, Accelerator, Lambda, CloudWatch, SNS Third-Party Solution: No Business Benefits: Since all data and workloads are moved to the European region, the customer could operate its business for European clients following GDPR rules. AWS WAF firewall provided an advanced level of data protection. By configuring RDS replicas, application read response time greatly improved. Configuration of application auto-scaling enabled provisioning of new instances as the user request/load increased, improving application performance. Data stored is maintained, and automated backups are ensured by performing regular data backup/restore drills.

case_study,"Bewakoof.com Migrates to AWS Cloud, Achieved Performance & Cost Reduction of 30%","Bewakoof.com Migrates to AWS Cloud, Achieved Performance & Cost Reduction of 30% Team Rapyder March 12, 2021 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Bewakoof.com Migrates to AWS Cloud, Achieved Performance & Cost Reduction of 30% About The Client Bewakoof.com is a direct-to-consumer online apparel company with a fast-growing and robust customer base since its inception in 2012. It has grown to become a successful business and lifestyle brand with an annual turnover of Rs. 210 crores in FY 2019-20. The company believes in improving the customer experience, product design, and supply chain processes through technological innovation. With a current employee strength of over 250, Bewakoof has sold more than one crore of products. Its app has over 60 lakh downloads and continues to grow by the hour. Bewakoof aims to become a household brand, cross Rs.1,000 in revenues by 2024, and leverage technology to drive the scale. The Business Need Bewakoof.com was earlier running its workloads in GCP, which was deployed and managed by its internal team. However, with Bewakoof’s focus on business growth and scale, its management moved the workloads and entire operations to AWS cloud, given the latter’s reliability, the numerous managed services, and the efﬁcient cost structure offerings. It wanted to leverage the AWS cloud suite to power its platform backend, marketing tech, and data services. Bewakoof was exploring a suitable and reliable partner to support them in migrating and deploying the workloads seamlessly onto AWS, with minimal downtime. The Client also wanted to ensure that best practices were being followed along with associated cost beneﬁts and no data loss. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with expertise and experience in successful cloud migration services, was chosen by the Client to help move the workloads to AWS Cloud. The Solution Rapyder’s team of Cloud Architects had several discovery sessions with the Client to understand the latter’s requirement for migration to AWS Cloud. The team then conceptualized and stitched a robust and customized solution around AWS services for the migration. The following proposed solution was implemented by Rapyder for a successful migration to AWS while ensuring that best practices and business continuity principles were also applied: EKS cluster in AWS was conﬁgured to setup the application on AWS. The CICD pipeline was built using native AWS services to ensure business continuity, faster go-to-market, and integration with other AWS services. The migration activity was completed within the agreed time frame with the Client. Automated threat detection was implemented using AWS GuardDuty, an ML-based threat detection service that helps identify malicious activities and unauthorized behavior to protect AWS accounts, workload, and data. The Benefits The pandemic and other factors that contributed to the ﬂuctuation of the market also impacted the operational and storage needs of the IT infrastructure in general. By applying business continuity principles and best practices in moving the workloads to AWS Cloud, the Rapyder team brought about a signiﬁcant increase in performance and cost efﬁciency, The cloud cost was reduced by 30 percent, and in the long term, the migration is likely to bring down the cost by a signiﬁcant 15-20 The operational overheads were reduced signiﬁcantly by leveraging the managed services of AWS, such as ElastiCache. Enabled to scale quickly to handle the unexpected spikes in trafﬁc, as and when the need arises. Cost efﬁciency was also achieved by using AMD-based instances on AWS. Application release management was made seamless with building the CICD process for the application running on EKS, thereby ensuring business. The process that was built using native AWS tools ensured better integrations with other AWS services. The migration will drive the platform’s growth by adding more capabilities and SKUs, leading to an increase in the number of monthly visitors. It will help the brand to go regional by enabling the designing of products that align with the cultural and regional ethos besides the region-speciﬁc weather conditions. This will require data streaming, analysis, and quick decision-making that are enabled with the AWS cloud. By leveraging AWS-managed services and deep tech support, Bewakoof can provide an enhanced user experience and customization at scale.

case_study,"NMIMS Cuts Costs by 28%, Up in Performance By Migrate from Azure To AWS","NMIMS Cuts Costs by 28%, Up in Performance By Migrate from Azure To AWS Team Rapyder March 9, 2021 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> NMIMS Cuts Costs by 28%, Up in Performance By Migrate from Azure To AWS About The Client Established in 1981, Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS) is a deemed-to-be University of global repute and a leading name for Management education in India. It is striving to become a globally admired university by 2030. NMIMS prides itself on consistently maintaining high-quality academic and research work with top national and global faculty members. Today, it has grown to 107 schools and 16 disciplines. At the highest level, national bodies, such as NAAC and NBA, accredit this multidisciplinary and multi-campus (across cities) institution. AACSB accredits its management institution, and AMBA accredits its Bengaluru and Hyderabad programs. The NMIMS academic infrastructure is at par with the best in the world today. The Business Need NMIMS was running its Learning Management System (LMS) workload on Microsoft Azure. It was run on a single server with challenges related to application performance besides incurring very high costs. LMS, being crucial in course creation and managing administration, tracking, reporting, and delivery of courses, its performance and cost-effectiveness were top priorities for the institution. The client was exploring a more suitable cloud computing service provider to address the existing challenges and signed up with a partner who could support the migration process. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with expertise and experience in successful cloud migration services, was chosen by the client for migration and implementation. The Solution Rapyder’s expert team of Cloud Architects had several discovery sessions with the client and did a complete analysis to understand the latter’s requirement for the migration. This was followed by Rapyder’s team conceptualizing and stitching a powerful and customized solution around AWS services for the task. The team helped migrate the client’s application from Azure to AWS, tested them on the new location, and consolidated all the web applications on AWS. The robust solution configured and implemented by Rapyder’s team for a successful migration to AWS is captured below: Having understood the need for future scaling on the cloud infrastructure, the Web and DB layers were split to facilitate scaling at a later stage and avoid any single-point failure. Application Load Balancers supporting content-based routing and applications running in containers were placed in front of the web layer as the first line of defense. It also provides additional visibility into the health of the target instances and containers and takes care of bad requests coming from the users. Custom metrics were configured on each server to track the utilization of all the infrastructure metrics. Amazon GuardDuty, the threat detection service, was implemented to intelligently monitor for malicious activities of the AWS account at the network level. Finally, a dry run was performed to ensure the application migration was successful. The Benefits The entire migration from Azure cloud to AWS cloud was done within 2 weeks, with the business up and running soon. This migration of the workload resulted in better response times for the application. The cost was 28% lower with AWS compared to the previous platform’s running cost.

case_study,Dizbi Achieved A Safe & Secure Environment By Migrating To AWS Cloud,"Dizbi Achieved A Safe & Secure Environment By Migrating To AWS Cloud Team Rapyder August 24, 2020 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Dizbi Achieved A Safe & Secure Environment By Migrating To AWS Cloud About The Client DIZBI is a digital product and services private limited company in Bengaluru, India. Dizbi is the technology arm of PDS Multinational Group, which has an annual turnover of 1.2 billion USD with its presence in 18 nations. Given Dizbi’s rich technology experience in developing enterprise frameworks, processes, and excellent resources, it has enabled the digital transformation journey of many enterprises with the philosophy of design thinking and applied thought. Dizbi, hereafter referred to as “Customer.” Customer Business Need: The customer acquired a company known as “Collective Heads.” Employees working under Collective Heads were also moved to work under Customer payroll. While these new users need to work on new projects, the customer wanted to have a safe & secure environment so that data privacy & security rules are intact while these new users are added to the system. They also wanted minimal operational overhead in maintaining the system. Below are the requirements from the customer: A separate isolated and secure remote workplace solution & avoid users connecting to their on-premises workspaces. When users need to work on development projects, they still need secure access to the applications/data deployed in the customer’s own data center. A highly secure and reliable solution that would keep their data safe & secure from any theft or loss. A centralized identity management system is in place to track & manage access smoothly. The solution should also serve as a contingency plan for their business continuity in case their premises are not accessible due to some unavoidable reasons. Solution: Our AWS Certified Solutions Architects conducted detailed workshop sessions with the customer to understand their existing setup, challenges, and requirements. We also captured remote users’ licensing and software requirements in the discovery. The following solution approach was proposed and implemented with best practices and business continuity principles and then migrated their production workload to AWS. AWS Workspaces was proposed as it is a highly reliable managed service with minimal operational overhead. A separate network with a combination of VPC / Subnets was created as per the best practices. All the workspaces were launched in private subnets & endpoints accessible through the Internet. AWS & Customer Data Centre was connected using AWS site-to-site VPN tunnel for establishing connectivity required between AWS Workspaces & On-Prem Data/applications. The workspaces were integrated with a self-managed Active Directory hosted on AWS EC2 for authentication with an AD connector. Workspaces were also hardened according to the requirement of the customer. Office & Anti-Virus packages were provided by the customer & included in the image to launch Workspaces. Installation packages for other agent-based software required were also included in the image. All traffic from the Internet has been routed through the site-to-site VPN tunnel to access the Internet and applications. Restricted policies were applied to prevent any data movement between AWS Workspaces & User-machine. Both web-based and client-based applications were configured as part of this setup. AWS Cloudtrail will be configured for tracking the API Calls. AWS Cloudwatch was configured for monitoring various matrices of the setup. AWS Services: AWS Workspaces, Directory Service, NAT Gateway, VPN, Config, S3, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, IAM Third-Party Solution: None Business Benefits: AWS workspaces solve customers’ need for business continuity for all users. With this solution, we were able to provide a secure and reliable remote workplace option for the user set separate from the existing setup. AWS VPN connectivity between AWS & On-Prem data center helped AWS workspaces communicate with applications & data residing on-prem with low latency. Data copy restrictions were applied from AWS Workspaces to users’ machines to safeguard data from theft & loss. AD setup enabled the customer to have standard identity management for their users in AWS Workspaces. To optimize the size of the AWS infra as per the actual size, conducted an infra audit post-implementation support period. Data stored is maintained, and automated backups are ensured by performing regular Data Backup/Restore drills. About Rapyder Rapyder is an agile, innovative company that makes Cloud work for you.

Nearby Technologies works on a B2B2C model through its various brands – PayNearby, Insure Nearby, BuyNearby, and others. PayNearby empowers retailers to offer digital services to local communities at the first mile, thereby boosting financial inclusion in India. Retailer services focus on Aadhaar-based banking services, Domestic Remittances, Bill Payments, Card Payments, and insurance services. PayNearBy, hereafter referred to as “Customer.” Customer Business Need: The Customer did the contingency planning for their business along with various operations required for their business & came up with multiple action items internally. One of the action items was to build VDI solutions for their internal users to work on their projects in case of any significant issues. Below were the requirements from the Customer: A highly secure and reliable solution that would keep their data safe & secure from any theft or loss. Secure connectivity & access to applications/data deployed in the Customer’s data center. User authentication uses their centralized identity management system at the Customer’s data center to track & manage access smoothly. The solution should also serve as a contingency plan for their business continuity in case their premises are not accessible due to some unavoidable reasons. Solution: Our AWS Certified Solutions Architects conducted detailed workshop sessions with the Customer to understand their existing setup, challenges, and requirements. In the discovery, we also captured remote users’ licensing and software requirements. Following the solution, the approach was proposed and implemented with best practices and business continuity principles and then migrated their production workload to AWS. AWS Workspaces was proposed as it is a highly reliable managed service with minimal operational overhead. A separate network with a combination of VPC/Subnets was created as per the best practices. All the workspaces were launched in private subnets & endpoints accessible through the Internet. AWS & Customer Data Centre was connected using AWS site-to-site VPN tunnel for establishing connectivity required between AWS Workspaces & On-Prem Data/applications. The workspaces were integrated with the ON-Prem Active directory for authentication with the AD connector. Workspaces were also hardened according to the requirement of the Customer. Office & Anti-Virus packages were provided by the Customer & included in the image to launch Workspaces. Installation packages for other agent-based software required were also included in the image. All traffic from the Internet has been routed through the site-to-site VPN tunnel to access the Internet and applications. Restricted policies were applied to prevent any data movement between AWS Workspaces & User-machine. Both web-based and client-based applications were configured as part of this setup. AWS CloudTrail will be configured for tracking the API Calls. AWS CloudWatch was configured for monitoring various matrices of the setup. AWS Services: AWS Workspaces, Directory Service, NAT Gateway, VPN, Config, S3, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, IAM Third-Party Solution: None Business Benefits: AWS workspaces solved customers’ need to have business continuity in place for all the users. With this solution, we were able to provide a secure and reliable remote workplace option for the user set separate from the existing setup. AWS VPN connectivity between AWS & On-Prem data center helped AWS workspaces communicate with applications & data residing on-prem with low latency. Data copy restrictions were applied from AWS Workspaces to users’ machines to safeguard data from theft & loss. Connectivity to On-Prem AD enabled the Customer to have common & standard identity management for their users in AWS Workspaces. Conducted infra audit after the post-implementation support period to optimize the size of the AWS Infra as per the actual usage.

Their vision is to equip students and teachers to achieve their goals through personalized content curation & AI. The Challenge The client has an e-learning platform through which it wants to impart teaching through technology. Their vision is to equip students and teachers to achieve their goals through personalized content curation & AI. The customer had deployed their application on AWS Cloud. They wanted a thorough audit to be done on their deployment on AWS for their learning application. The customer was also looking for a transcoding requirement to integrate with their application so that different formats can be viewed on the platform depending on the user’s choice. The transcoding was being done manually until then. The Solution Rapyder collaborated with the Customer to understand the application and deployment architecture before the audit. As part of the audit, the following things were done: All the security best practices were scanned and reported to the customer on what could be changed. All the security groups were audited, and appropriate changes were suggested and implemented. The AWS Code Deploy would pick the build from AWS S3 and deploy it into the auto-scaling groups of the Test environment. Cloudwatch metrics that were missing as part of the monitoring were implemented, and alarms and dashboards were created for all the resources. The instance type changes were suggested depending on the utilization of the servers for 3 months. Lambda function was created to transcode the videos into the required formats and inform the application about the status. SNS was configured on the S3 bucket to trigger the lambda function. Unused instances were recommended to be terminated. The Benefits The customer was pleased with the audit’s recommendations, and the recommendations were implemented. They integrated the transcoding solution into the application, which reduced the manual transcoding that was done before. It gave cost benefits and a secure infrastructure.

case_study,Tix Technologies Migrates to AWS Cloud with Rapyder,"Tix Technologies Migrates to AWS Cloud with Rapyder Team Rapyder December 15, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Tix Technologies Migrates to AWS Cloud with Rapyder About The Client TIX was founded in 2009 with the single goal of making live events more affordable in Australia. They achieved this by launching Lasttix – a destination for discount ticket offers to theatres, concerts, musicals, and more. Fast forward 10 years, and they have expanded their goal also to make live entertainment more accessible and have done this by launching the TIX app, which, in one straightforward interface, helps its users instantly identify the best ticket prices no matter where they are or what their budget is. TIX now operates in 4 countries with over 1.6 million members. The Business Need CUSTOMER had developed a .NET application for a ticket-selling product, built using Windows Stack, and wanted to host this application on the Cloud. After discussions with the Rapyder team of Cloud engineers, they decided to go with AWS to benefit from the flexibility of Infrastructure sizing and to have a Scalable infrastructure along with High Availability for their different components, as they were expecting massive traffic on the platform. They also wanted to have CI/CD pipelines for each of their application components. The Solution To address the business objectives that needed to be achieved, Rapyder implemented a solution on AWS that, considering the future growth expected, provided Tix Technologies with a flexible and scalable environment: The application has UI, API, and DB layers. All the servers were launched in a private subnet to prevent the servers from being exposed to the public directly. High availability was factored in, and servers were launched in HA mode across different availability zones. UI and API layers were deployed in Auto-scaling groups behind the Application Load Balancer to meet the scaling demand of the Customer. MSSQL enterprise edition was used as DB to run the database in Always-On mode so that high availability would be taken care of. AWS-managed Microsoft AD was implemented, and all the servers made part of the AD to manage authentication centrally. Servers using IAM roles to access the services like S3 and Cloudwatch. IAM users created and only required access provided by using IAM policies. Custom metrics were set up on all servers, and monitoring was enabled by using Cloudwatch. Cloudwatch alarms were also created for CPU, Memory, and Disk Utilization. Antivirus was installed on each server to protect the servers from malware attacks. AWS CloudFormation is used for spinning up the entire infrastructure. CI/CD pipelines have been set up for each application component. AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy were used for CI and CD. Jenkins hosted on EC2 machine. AWS Guard Duty was enabled, and a custom solution was developed using lambda scripts to take action on the findings. Custom Lambda function was also written to notify the Customer of CI/CD. CloudTrail was enabled for all regions. AWS Services EC2, Auto Scaling, Load Balancer, S3, AWS AD, Guard Duty, Code Pipeline, Code Deploy, Lambda, SNS, Work Mail, Systems Manager Third-Party Services Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise 14.0.3023.8 MSSQL Enterprise edition was used for Database in Always-On mode. This enabled the data to be synchronized between two nodes at any time. The application connects to the Database using the Listener, which takes care of the primary and secondary nodes. All the reads will go to a secondary node to distribute the traffic across two nodes. Backups and custom monitoring scripts have also been set up on the databases to monitor the database. Trend Micro Deep Security Trend Micro Deep Security has been used for each server to save the servers from malicious attacks. The agent has been installed on each server, and the new auto-scaling server which will come up will activate the agent using the command in user data. The Benefits Tix Technologies is now successfully running its workloads on AWS Cloud, which can handle the massive traffic with the help of Auto-Scaling groups. All their deployments are automated, and there is no human intervention the same which has reduced their go-to-market. The servers are near auto-healable as the environment is configured to be running in high availability (behind the load balancer and in Auto Scaling groups). Thus, there is no downtime for the applications. Next Case Study: Easypolicy migrates to AWS with Rapyder Cloud Solutions Keep up to date with the latest Case Studies and Stories from Rapyder.

This solution was deployed on AWS LightSail using single-tenant architecture. The deployment was done on separate servers for each client they were supporting. They were looking to make this existing solution more scalable with High-availability multi-tenant architecture to support all their clients with the same single infrastructure. The solution was also highly scalable, along with provisioning for content delivery and server caching with the ability to program code to deploy on the server on every commit they maintained in Code Commit. The Solution The Cloud Consultants of Rapyder conducted a detailed study of the customer’s application. They designed the right solution and configuration that could support the seamless functioning of the application to overcome the challenges mentioned above. The consultants of Rapyder proposed the following solution to achieve the desired results: Amazon EC2 server was provisioned, and all the requirements were carried out. Route53 was used for DNS pointing. RDS was created on a private subnet and restored with SQL dump. Servers were behind ELB and in the auto-scaling Group for high availability and scalability. Auto-scaling launch configuration was created and deployed with a script to fetch code on every new server launch. Lambda code was written to copy the code from AWS code commit repository to the server whenever on every commit. For high security, the Lambda function was created within the same network. AWS Redis is used for providing a central server cache so as not to lose the session cache. AWS CloudFront was implemented for content delivery and restricted bucket only to CDN for better security. The Benefits Deployment of code was automated, reducing the time to market. Auto-scaling reduced the time and manpower required for managing the server monitoring task. The client was able to commit many changes to the code at any time. Security was enhanced by restricting access only through CloudFront. SSL certificate was applied on the load balancer.

case_study,Neogrowth’s ROI of 30% With a Fully Automated CI/CD Solution,"Neogrowth’s ROI of 30% With a Fully Automated CI/CD Solution Team Rapyder November 29, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Neogrowth’s ROI of 30% With a Fully Automated CI/CD Solution About The Client Neogrowth is a pioneer in lending based on the underwriting of digital payment data. It is a NBFC registered with RBI organization and started commercial operations in 2013. The company’s proprietary technology platform offers unsecured loans to merchants who accept customers’ cards and other digital payments. By far, Neogrowth has partnered with 13000+ business merchants to help them grow their businesses. Their mission is to have a positive social impact on the financial lives of small & medium business merchants across India. More than 50% of these merchants are creditworthy but have been excluded from accessing loans based on traditional underwriting methods. The Business Need As an organization that provides loans to SMEs, maintaining a proper customer relation and interaction base is a huge requirement. Hence, the client was developing an internal CRM application for which they performed manual deployments in their environment. This made the development process highly prone to human error, reduced efficiency, and affected the code quality. Developers at Neogrowth were logging into the production servers, which was a major security risk for the organization. With these pain points: Overall development time increased with backlogs of non-critical errors. The process did not allow optimal utilization of resources. Coding process was prone to human error, and rectifying changes was causing unintended consequences. The Solution The client was using GitHub as their version control system for which AWS Code Pipelines were implemented for each environment that would get triggered whenever any commit was made to the corresponding branch of the GitHub repository. As soon as the code was committed, Code Pipeline would get triggered, pulling the code from the repository and triggering the Jenkins build. Jenkins was used to validate the config variables. Hence, in any scenario of any variable missing, the entire build would fail. For any deployment failures, Code Deploy Rollbacks were implemented to deploy the previously stable running version of the application. Upon successful build, AWS Code Deploy would get triggered and Deploy the artifacts to the target servers. The Benefits Cloud experts at Rapyder provided the whole solution in just two weeks, in which the right solution and configuration that could support the seamless functioning of the application were designed to achieve the desired results. Benefits that Neogrowth witnessed were: With a fully automated CI/CD solution, any scope of human-prone errors was removed, which increased the development cycle. With automation in the development cycle, the time to market this CRM application was reduced to 40%. The client witnessed an ROI of 30%. As the development lifecycle was automated, developers now spend more time on development than operations.

They believe that the software must become more intelligent to continue delighting the customer. Frrole has mastered the social data set that can be best utilized to understand consumers at scale and to build the Google of the social web, unleashing the power of accurate and predictive consumer insight for all the software in the world, making it truly intelligent. The Business Need The client uses social media data to build the Google social web. They were already using Azure cloud services for its two flagship products, Scout and Deeper Sense. However, they wanted to migrate to AWS for two major reasons: Reduce the overall cost, Apply best practices to help scale. Thus, Frrole sought an AWS expert to help them successfully migrate. Since both applications were business-critical, the client wanted minimal downtime during the migration. Also, the amount of data to be migrated was in terabytes, and the entire migration had to be done within extremely short timelines. The Solution After studying the working of the applications, cloud experts at Rapyder came up with an optimum solution for migrating the application from Azure to AWS. Our cloud experts stitched a solution with AWS services, and the following solutions were implemented: A VPN connection from AWS to Azure account was provisioned for seamless connectivity. The NoSQL database was extended into AWS, considering the vast amount of data to be transferred. The search engine of the application had terabytes of data in the clusters of AWS by extending the clusters into AWS, which ensured zero downtime. All other servers were created in a private subnet only to be accessed within a VPC for security with a load balancer. The NoSQL database and search engine cluster were deployed across availability zones for HA. Open VPN server was provisioned to connect directly to the instances in private servers locally. NAT gateway was used for all outgoing internet connections from private servers. Reserved instances recommendations helped in reducing the cost further after. The Benefits Considering the timeline requested by the client, the entire migration, including the database of 5 TB, was completed within 10 days. After migrating the entire application to AWS, the client recognized a cost saving of almost 25% compared to the expenses paid on Azure. The solution provided is highly available and scalable at all application layers.

This helped the client better serve its growing customer base and remain competitive in the market.

Now they have more time to focus on improving the features and quality of their company’s services. Modernizing IT Infrastructure and the ‘Pay As You Go’ Model of Rapyder DevOps as a Service helped the client save a lot of money.

The data center infrastructure was up for renewal, and the Customer wanted more flexibility in managing their infrastructure and was exploring AWS. The management of HotelHub was also looking for a platform on which they could innovate their business solutions faster. The Solution Our AWS-certified Solutions Architects conducted multiple rounds of discussions with HotelHub and developed a proposal that would best fulfill the Customer’s requirements. Best practices and business continuity principles were applied to the solution, and the following considerations/ Architecture Approach was taken: AWS Ireland was chosen as the region for hosting, keeping in mind their customer base. All the servers were created in private subnets in different AZs behind the load balancer. Web Servers would connect to API servers via Network Load Balancer, also provisioned in the private subnet. Both Web and API layers were highly available, with multiple servers running behind the load balancer. Static servers were used at both the App and UI layers, considering the predictive nature of traffic on the application. MySQL was set up on EC2 instances across AZs for High Availability. Custom automation was written for the auto-failover of MySQL instances. The MS SQL standard was also run on EC2 in mirroring mode across AZ for high availability. Failover of the DB was also automated and tested by leveraging Route53 private hosted zone with Lambda, which was configured to update the DNS in case of failover. Microsoft Active Directory was hosted in two AZs for high availability and synced with on-premises AD. Site-to-site VPN connection with on-premises to send the logs to Splunk for log analysis. Native backups were set up on the database setups and configured to go to AWS S3. AWS Services EC2, Lambda, CloudWatch, Guard Duty, AWS Config, S3 Third-Party Services SQL Server, Ncache, Symantec Antivirus, Splunk The Benefits Today, the migrated workloads are running successfully on AWS without any downtimes.

case_study,Extramarks Achieves 15% ROI by Leveraging AWS Auto Scaling,"Extramarks Achieves 15% ROI by Leveraging AWS Auto Scaling Team Rapyder October 7, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Extramarks Achieves 15% ROI by Leveraging AWS Auto Scaling About The Client Extramarks aims to transform the conventional education system by providing modern-day total learning digital solutions to students and teachers. With easy-to-understand, engaging content empowered by advanced technology, Extramarks effectively creates a bright, personalized, and interactive learning environment in the classroom and at home. With features like- Progress Tracker, Mentor Support, Study Scheduler, Group Work, and many more, this one-app-one solution is currently used by over 9000 schools across India, Singapore, Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, and South Africa. The Business Need ‘Extramarks’ interactive sessions provide deep, immersive learning through Learn-Practice-Test (LPT) Pedagogy. In this technology-driven time, Extramarks is constantly promoting independent learning for its stakeholders (parents, teachers & students) while maintaining continuity from school to home and ensuring effective communication among the stakeholders. However, over the years, their application was running on standalone servers in the public domain to handle the incoming load. This made them dependent on the central server and possessed many security issues, undoubtedly making the application vulnerable to attacks and malware. The client was looking to cater to three prime requirements: A solution that would automate their scaling. Secure its application from any kind of attacks and, Deploy their application at a faster pace. The Solution The Cloud Consultants at Rapyder designed the right solution and configuration that could support the seamless functioning of the application to overcome the challenges mentioned above. The consultants at Rapyder proposed the following solutions to achieve the desired results: The servers were migrated to private subnets to make the application secure. AWS WAF was implemented with CloudFront to tackle the vulnerabilities of the website. AWS Auto Scaling was implemented to handle the load based on the incoming load on the servers. OWASP WAF rules such as Cross Site Match Conditions, Size constraint conditions, SQL injection, IP Match Conditions, and String regex Match Conditions were implemented to prevent further vulnerabilities. For new deployments to the server running in Auto Scaling groups, a script was written that the client would deploy the application on one static server and then run the custom script by Rapyder. The script was designed to take the AMI of the server and deploy it on Auto Scaling Group, ensuring that the new application was running successfully. The Benefits With Rapyder’s consultation and the right solution, Extramarks achieved the desired results and scalability on their application. Here’s a lowdown of the benefits derived by them: Servers now on private subnets were no longer publicly accessible and restricted any unauthorized access, making the server secure. The client no longer needed to perform Manual Scaling. With the implementation of AWS Auto Scaling, Extramarks achieved an ROI of up to 15% on AWS cost. Our scheduled scaling at peak times made them witness further savings of 10%. CloudFront by AWS helped the client cache the content dynamically and made them leverage edge location for faster content delivery.

SquarePanda is an award-winning, edtech literacy platform and research-based phonics learning system for pre-readers and early readers worldwide. Equipped with this AI-based platform that assesses and engages learners, SquarePanda aims to empower all children to reach their full potential. Square Panda’s adaptive platform helps children globally, across skill sets and socio-economic backgrounds, to equip themselves with reading, writing, and communicative skills. The learning experience is joyful and based on innovative teaching practices. The Business Need The applications were already hosted on AWS in the US. However, with the new setup in India, SquarePanda wanted to expand its operations in India and China and implement the hosting of applications on AWS in these new geographical locations. The client wanted to address the business need for a faster go-to-market facility and deliver an enhanced customer experience that would be brought about with this implementation. It was looking for a partner who could provide them with an AWS solution for their application and ensure scalability, high availability, and security. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with extensive experience and competency in successful cloud migration and implementation services, was chosen and partnered with. This led to the Customer looking for a solution that would improve its delivery and support of IT while lowering the total cost of ownership. The Solution To effectively address the business need of the Client, Rapyder’s team of Cloud Architects thoroughly studied the former’s requirement for implementation. A customized solution around AWS services was implemented while applying Cloud Deployment Architecture best practices and business continuity principles. Rapyder implemented the following proposed solution and architecture approach: In the new AWS infrastructure, all the servers were launched in private subnets for ease of administration and control, with most components deployed in multi-AZ configuration to avoid single-point failure. AWS-managed load balancer was used to balance the traffic across two availability zones. The balancer was configured to route all site traffic, including dynamic pages. AWS-managed NAT Gateway was used for any outbound traffic from servers in private subnets. Monitoring and alerts were set up on each server to monitor metrics like CPU, memory, and disk. Cloudtrail was enabled for all regions. CI/CD pipelines were set up for each application component, where AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy were used. The Benefits Time-to-market was significantly reduced by 30%, with high agility achieved. The new infrastructure was up and running in two weeks. No single point of failure was witnessed as the environment was running in high availability behind the load balancer.

The global pandemic has reinforced the importance of local Kirana stores and changed how these Kirana stores function. With the surge in demand, various demand and supply-related challenges have emerged. Social distancing and hygiene norms have made e-payment the new normal. Research suggests that the customers these stores won during the pandemic can only be retained if they offer home delivery, credit, hyper-local apps, and hyper-local merchandising services. SnapBizz has been working to organize and digitize these Kirana stores to improve their profitability. However, the need to digitize everything from stocks to payments has led to an unexpected surge in traffic, affecting the solution’s performance. The client wanted a solution that would address the following needs: Focus on business innovation, Automate scaling of the application to handle traffic, Lower their infrastructure cost, Improve application performance. The Solution The Cloud Consultants at Rapyder designed a scalable architecture on AWS to address the over-provisioning of resources. The solution had the following features: Considered AWS Mumbai to host applications since the user base in India. Hosted all servers behind the load balancer in private subnets across different availability zones (AZ) to reduce latency. Terminated all incoming traffic on the application load balancer and routed them to appropriate servers in the backend to ensure a single-entry point and avoid internet exposure. Deployed app servers in autoscaling groups for scalability and high availability. Applied AWS Certificate Manager on load balancers to securely manage SSL certificates. Used load balancers to offload SSL certificates and send traffic to the appropriate instance. Used RDS MySQL in multi-AZ to ensure high availability of the global database. Used MS SQL standard on EC2 for reporting purposes. Migrated from Azure CosmosDB to Amazon DynamoDB. Used AWS Data Pipeline to replicate data from DynamoDB to SQL Server. Used AWS ElastiCache for Redis caching.

case_study,Rapyder Builds Infrastructure As Code Using Terraform,"Rapyder Builds Infrastructure As Code Using Terraform Team Rapyder September 15, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Rapyder Builds Infrastructure As Code Using Terraform About The Company The client started the business as a consultancy helping large companies run competitions in schools. It soon became evident, however, that data was the key to all things marketing. Incorporated as a Limited company in 1991, the company has been using data to help education suppliers market and sell effectively to schools and colleges. The Challenge The client sought a cloud-agnostic tool to orchestrate the infrastructure onto multiple public clouds (AWS, Azure). They wanted the infrastructure to be up in a few minutes. The client had different environments like production, staging, and QA to test. Database backups were also included as part of the infrastructure setup. The Solution DevOps engineers at Rapyder Cloud Solutions reviewed and analyzed the client’s requirement where the need was to orchestrate the infrastructure within a few minutes, and that also should be cloud agnostic. Engineers at Rapyder used Terraform to codify the provisioning of infrastructure onto the public cloud and enabled this provisioning to these clouds through automation. By automating manual configurations, we also eliminated the possibility of human error. The solution provided by Rapyder also took care of the database backup for the situation when the infrastructure is destroyed – automated backup of the database would be kicked off in that scenario. Not only infra but Rapyder also automated the application deployment process by integrating GitLab (an open source software) to improve software development and accelerate the software delivery. As a result, the client’s application could be brought up within no time and without human intervention. The client can now test their application and deploy it in the production environment without downtime using this solution. The client‘s time to market is significantly reduced. The solution allows the client to orchestrate the infra as and when needed. The Benefits The client can launch the infrastructure over multiple public clouds within a brief time (a matter of minutes). The client has the flexibility to launch the infrastructure as and when needed. The automated deployments help the client push the application into production seamlessly, reducing the market time. Automated database backup ensures they always have a copy of their latest database that can be used in DR.

case_study,AWS DevOps Services Case Study – Implemented a CI/CD Pipeline on Tix,"AWS DevOps Services Case Study – Implemented a CI/CD Pipeline on Tix Team Rapyder August 29, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> AWS DevOps Services Case Study – Implemented a CI/CD Pipeline on Tix About The Client Tix is a ticket booking application based in Australia with a single goal of making live events more affordable & accessible. They take out the pain of searching different sources to find tickets and put them all in the palm of your hand with the TIX app. The application operates in 6 cities across 5 countries with over 1.60 million members & app users. The Challenge In this competitive era, every business aims to provide its customers with the best product and service in no time. TIX aims to create one platform where live entertainment can be affordable and more accessible. For this, the client was developing a B2C online booking application to be hosted on AWS cloud and had two prime requirements: They were looking for AWS expertise that would provide solutions on AWS and help them implement the entire Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with no manual intervention and auto rollbacks in the case of deployment failures with AWS services. A highly scalable and reliable architecture for their application. A CapEx-based solution instead of an OpEx for the application to change the application’s architecture later if needed. The Solution They were looking for AWS experts that would help them provide solutions for shortening their development cycle with reduced deployments and auto rollbacks. The client had 3 different environments, Dev, SIT, and Production Environment. For each pipeline, unique AWS CodePipelines were implemented for automated deployments. WebHooks were configured for each pipeline so that the pipelines would get triggered with every commit. AWS Parameter Store was used to store & secure the configuration data, which will be replaced at the time of deployment based on the environment. Jenkins was configured for MS builds which will push the binaries to AWS S3 to manage, organize and secure the data. A package manager server was also set up from where the application can download the Node and NuGet packages, not making it available to the public internet for downloading the packages. This, in return, reduced the build time. Code Deploy was used to deploy the artifact to the target servers to avoid downtime during the deployment. Notifications were set up at the pipeline level to notify clients about new deployments and failures. Rollbacks were configured; the previous stable version will be deployed in case of a failed deployment. CloudFormation scripts were written for infrastructure to replicate the architecture in a short period. AWS Architecture The Benefits The entire process for all the 3 environments was successfully implemented in the time frame of 1.5 months with full automation. After implementing the solutions provided by Rapyder, TIX witnessed sustainable results for their application development. Here’s a low down of benefits derived: With the help of CloudFormation, the developers could replicate the whole architecture and launch it in no time. A fully automated CI/CD solution eradicated the risk of manual-prone error entirely and fastened the development cycle. 30% of developers’ time is now invested in coding instead of manual deployments and resolving bugs. Manual implementation for a CI/CD solution would have taken around an hour, and de-bugging an error would take the whole day. But with a fully automated CI/CD solution, the process was completed in 10 minutes. The CloudFormation script (Infrastructure as Code) made the development and deployment process efficient, enabling faster go-to-market features.

case_study,BPO Firm Builds a Secure Remote Working Environment Using Amazon Workspaces,"BPO Firm Builds a Secure Remote Working Environment Using Amazon Workspaces Team Rapyder August 17, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> BPO Firm Builds a Secure Remote Working Environment Using Amazon Workspaces About The Client Our Customer is a pan-India enterprise providing best in class business processing solutions. They have personnel working in three shifts in a day to cater to their customers across the globe. The Business Need The users, when connecting from outside office, faced problems with access to their business applications – both performance slowness and access downtimes. The data also needed to be protected which was a critical thing with respect to DLP. The frequent bad user experience also led to a low towards IT. One prime area of concern was to ensure the security of their data, which had some increased risks when all users were field based. This led to the Customer looking for a solution that would improve its delivery and support of IT while lowering the total cost of ownership. The Solution Solution Architects at Rapyder carried out an assessment of the Customer’s environment & requirements and recommended that they move to a managed workspace environment. All users provisioned on AWS Workspace in the Singapore region. Hardened operating system environments were used as a secure base to package the applications. Identity and access management was established using identity federation back to the corporate Active Directory. Multiple security features included – WAF, USB lockdown, IP lockdown, copy & paste locked down. A VPN tunnel was established between AWS and their data center to allow their access to their enterprise applications. A highly resilient Amazon Workspaces platform was created, ensuring all services are placed across two different availability zones so that in the event of an AZ failure, the services automatically restart and will be available in an alternate zone. The Benefits Better management of infra-structure for optimal resource utilization and application performance. Users can work from anywhere and the company’s data stays on company systems. The new user setup is 75% faster than the old environment, and users are provisioned in as little as 30 minutes. Improved cost efficiency by systematically managing new hires, terminations, and changes, efficiently and effectively.

Traditional underwriting methods in India exclude more than 50% of creditworthy SMEs. With a mission to bring a social impact in this segment, they cater primarily to this underserved market by adopting an innovative approach to validate the business’s creditworthiness and identify and serve these credit-worthy merchants. They have launched commercial operations in multiple cities across India with plans for more growth. The Challenge The customer was running multiple business-critical applications on AWS. The applications were not horizontally scalable and running in a single Availability Zone. To mitigate the risk of single-point failure, the customer reached out to Rapyder for a solution. Then, executing a Disaster Recovery strategy ensuring Business Continuity with a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) / Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of close to 30 mins. The Solution Rapyder did a complete study of the Disaster Recovery requirements of the customer. We evaluated different strategies of Active-Passive and Active-Active Disaster Recovery (DR) models. A TCO analysis was done by running an Active-Active setup, and it was found to be more expensive than the customer had budgeted. Rapyder then used a solution provided by one of AWS ISV partners to use block-level replication to replicate the data and server from the production AWS account to a separate DR AWS account. All configurations were made so the servers could be brought up within 15 mins, which exceeded the customer’s expectations. We continue to support our clients in conducting mock drills periodically. The Benefit The customer was delighted with the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) solution and implementation of the project by Rapyder. The Disaster Recovery drills were conducted, and the Recovery Time Objective was found to be less than 15 mins.

case_study,RupeeRedee Achieved 5X Capability by Migrating to AWS Cloud Services,"RupeeRedee Achieved 5X Capability by Migrating to AWS Cloud Services Team Rapyder June 19, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> RupeeRedee Achieved 5X Capability by Migrating to AWS Cloud Services About The Client Since its inception in 2018, Gurugram-based fintech start-up RupeeRedee has provided instant small-ticket and flexible digital personal loans to the underserved population. It leverages state-of-the-art technology and data sciences to make lending safe and fast. The start-up’s customers include first-time borrowers who could not secure loans elsewhere, salaried, and self-employed. RupeeRedee has been expanding its operations rapidly and today its services in over 35 cities from just ten cities in 2018. Its services are available 24X7, thus beneficial during emergencies, which could be personal and business-related. The Business Need With the expansion of operations, the number of web and mobile applications increased, and the expected increase in demand and new opportunities required a much more robust technology infrastructure. Additionally, the intricate architecture, with the mixed-use of open-source and enterprise technologies, required a large-scale and robust cloud service that was scalable and secure! The existing service provider had the following challenges: performance issues, downtime issues, best practices being compromised, unable to address the need for redundancy, auto-scaling, and disaster recovery. Being prone to risks was inevitable as they were running on a public server. Moreover, there was a lack of monitoring and other support challenges from Rackspace too! RupeeRedee wanted to migrate its system to AWS for better availability and reliability. Earlier, they were leveraging Vyatta Gateway, where the firewall and VPN were being used by Rackspace, which had to be mapped and replicated from scratch upon migration as AWS did not support Vyatta. They were also looking at external security elements available with AWS to be included to improve overall security. The organization was looking for a partner with AWS expertise to help develop its complete infrastructure, including 40+ cloud servers to AWS cloud. They were also looking at external security elements to be included to improve overall security. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with expertise and experience in successful cloud migration services, was chosen by the client to help migrate to AWS Cloud. The Solution Rapyder’s team of Cloud Architects had several online assessments (due to social distancing and lockdown) and discovery sessions with the client’s infrastructure and DevOps teams to understand the latter’s requirement for migration to AWS Cloud. The team then conceptualized and created a robust and customized solution around AWS services for the migration. The following proposed solution was implemented by Rapyder for a successful migration to AWS while ensuring that the best practices and business continuity principles are also applied. Amazon EC2 was leveraged as it provided resizable compute capacity in the AWS cloud. By offering IaaS, it also provided complete control of computing resources, which could be scaled as per requirement. AWS IAM was used to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Microsoft SQL Servers, their primary database management system, which they were running, was migrated in negligible downtime. Amazon Aurora, which Amazon RDS fully manages, was leveraged. This provides security, reliability, and high availability. Amazon RDS automates time-consuming administrative tasks too. Security was a critical factor being a fintech solution platform. AWS WAF was used to help protect web applications or APIs against attacks that could impact availability and security while consuming excessive resources. Amazon CloudWatch was used to monitor the applications and alerts in case of any changes in resource utilization or unhealthy servers, wherein timely action could be taken. The Benefits This migration to AWS cloud has brought several benefits to RupeeRedee platform. There was a significant improvement in handling a higher number of customer traffic, 500% more! Scalability was established for any future requirements. A significant reduction in costs was observed despite higher volumes of traffic. Savings of up to 30 percent with a few more optimizations is expected with the migration. The new program’s free AWS credits were an additional bonus. The response time on the website and the app is much faster, with fewer downtimes. There has been an overall improvement in user experience too. All earlier manual interventions, such as regular backups, fault tolerance, and mirroring, have been automated with this transition.

The Solution To effectively address the business need of the Client, Rapyder’s team of Cloud Architects thoroughly studied the former’s requirement for implementation. A customized solution around AWS services was implemented while applying Cloud Deployment Architecture best practices and business continuity principles. Rapyder implemented the following proposed solution and architecture approach: In the new AWS infrastructure, all the servers were launched in private subnets for ease of administration and control, with most components deployed in multi-AZ configuration to avoid single-point failure. AWS-managed load balancer was used to balance the traffic across two availability zones. The balancer was configured to route all site traffic, including dynamic pages. AWS-managed NAT Gateway was used for any outbound traffic from servers in private subnets. Monitoring and alerts were set up on each server to monitor metrics like CPU, memory, and disk. Cloudtrail was enabled for all regions. CI/CD pipelines were set up for each application component, where AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy were used. The Benefits Time-to-market was significantly reduced by 30%, with high agility achieved. The new infrastructure was up and running in two weeks.

case_study,Rapyder Empowers Stellaps with a Cutting-Edge Gen-AI Powered Multilingual Chatbot!,"Rapyder Empowers Stellaps with a Cutting-Edge Gen-AI Powered Multilingual Chatbot! Team Rapyder May 7, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Rapyder Empowers Stellaps with a Cutting-Edge Gen-AI Powered Multilingual Chatbot! Introduction: In today’s competitive business landscape, providing exceptional customer service is no longer optional – it’s essential. Stellapps stands out as the first of its kind startup in India, dedicated to the digitization of the dairy supply chain. Founded in 2011, it is an IIT Madras incubated, Bangalore based, Internet of Things (IoT) startup with a primary focus on data acquisition and machine learning. Milk, being the largest crop on this planet, highlights a strong demand for technology interventions, particularly in emerging markets where the yield per animal is low, traceability is inadequate, and quality is not up to the mark. Digitization of the Agri-Dairy supply chain in emerging markets is the area where Stellapps aids in unlocking unprecedented value on a very large scale. Industry: Dairy Offering: Gen AI Business Need: StellApps has an application the caters to farmers from rural India. The application helps farmers to get the detail for the farming related queries. Currently the existing application is not able to handle the native language features and sharing response only in English. As a result of this end-user of the application are not getting the desired benefit from this application. The StellApps team wants to enhance the application by introducing a feature that allows users to record audio questions in their native language. These questions relate to topics such as taking care of cattle, managing/handling the crops etc. In response, the application should provide response in the farmer’s local language with correct and accurate details. Implementation: Rapyder has proposed a solution powered by GenAI capabilities. We proposed solution using AWS Bedrock to answer the query from the existing documents. We are taking RAG based approach using Amazon RDS PostgreSQL as Vector DB and Amazon S3 as raw storage. We are creating a data pipeline by using services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon ECS with Fargate, AWS ECR and Amazon API Gateway to keep the data updated. To build the GenAI based solution for the use case, there are two major activities that we need to address as part of the solution: Build Knowledge base for chatbot using PDF document Build the chat API that understands the user query and provide the accurate response Farmers or villagers, the primary users, can ask questions in their local language by recording their voices. The audio is then translated to English using the Whisper API hosted on ECS Fargate. The translated text is used to search PGVector, extracting relevant information from documents. This information, along with RAG based approach using Bedrock, generates responses in English text. Stellapps own application uses the transcript from our solution to create the output in native farmers source language. Solution Architecture: The core of our GenAI solution is a microservices-based architecture deployed on the AWS cloud. This architecture provides scalability, flexibility, and resilience, ensuring that the chatbot can meet the demands of Stellapps. Component: Knowledge Base pipeline: As per AWS best practices, we have kept raw data in S3 bucket. An AWS Lambda event will be triggered to pre-process the uploaded data. We are performing the embedding using Amazon Bedrock Titan model on the raw data, and ingesting the embeddings into Amazon RDS PGVector DB. GenAI Activity: We have created Whisper ECS API that accepts audio, and performs the transcription, and parse transcription to LLM API. We are converting the English input text into embeddings using Amazon Bedrock Titan model. We have implemented the data retrieval on VectorDB using similarity search algorithm using Langchain based approach. Response is getting created by using Claude2 model with help of Langchain based RAG pipeline using refined prompts after getting input from the StellApps team. As part of best practices, if the context or answer is not available for the given query chatbot is politely asking the end-user to connect with customer care and relevant field expert doctors. LLM based tuning & improvement: Used chunking for the knowledge-based data while embedding data into PGVector. Experimented different “K” values while setting up RAG pipeline to get the better results while performing similarity for the query. Performed parameter tuning for TopP, token length and temperature control for getting the good accuracy. Added prompt engineering best practices and ensured that no false information is being provided as response and input is added to get the information vetted from the doctor or field experts. AWS Services: Amazon S3 Amazon RDS Amazon ECS with Fargate AWS ECR Amazon API Gateway AWS Lambda AWS Bedrock Reaping Rewards: Added feature to handle Indian languages with higher accuracy, this will help to get a larger Indian user-base. Customer is currently serving more than 100K farmers who are set to get benefitted from this solution. Reduced effort and maintenance cost for Knowledge base pipeline. Multi-lingual chatbot helped the business acquire more users and create more penetration across multiple geographical location serving with more than 15 languages across India. Customer is already acquired 17% new customer and growing As for many issue users were earlier visiting veterinary doctor, facing waiting time resulting in unsatisfactory outcome and spending cost for trivial issues. With this solution Customer team received positive feedback and appreciation for the integration and cost saved for the end-user.

case_study,Revolutionizing user experience with Gen-AI powered chatbot,"Revolutionizing user experience with Gen-AI powered chatbot Team Rapyder May 2, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Revolutionizing user experience with Gen-AI powered chatbot Introduction: Fibe has consistently aimed at serving young professionals, a group often overlooked by traditional financial institutions. Since its inception, Fibe has processed over a million loans and has been pivotal in simplifying access to financial services, making it a beloved tool for mid-income individuals across India. Fibe, hereafter referred to as “Customer”. Industry: Fintech Offering: Gen AI Business Need: Customer was using traditional dialogue driven chatbot to answer the loan related queries. The queries range from simple FAQ to customer specific questions related to payment due dates etc. Because the customer was using dialogue driven approach, lots of questions from end users were restricted to receive answers only for predefined questions. This caused an increase in the number of calls to their call center which in turn increased the operational cost. The customer was looking for a context based free flow chatbot to interact with the end users. Implementation: To address the identified shortcomings and enhance the chatbot’s capabilities, a GenAI-based solution is proposed. This solution will integrate several key features to ensure improved performance and adaptability: Knowledge Base Management: Develop a centralized system to manage FAQ sheets, APIs, and other business documents, streamlining information access and updates. Contextually Relevant Responses: Utilize advanced LLMs to generate tailored responses based on user queries, enhancing accuracy and usefulness. Free-flow Human-like Conversation: Leverage existing data for the chatbot to engage in natural, personalized conversations with users, improving user experience Integrate RAG System: Incorporate a Retrieval Augmentation & Generation system to dynamically retrieve real-time data, enriching chatbot responses with up-to-date information. Handling Dynamic and Static Queries: Equip the chatbot to effectively handle both real-time and static inquiries, ensuring timely and accurate responses to user queries. AWS Deployment Architecture: Implementation Strategies and Enhancements: 1. Chat Pipeline: Platform Evolution: The chatbot journey commenced with Amazon Bedrock Claude 2 and evolved to Amazon Bedrock Claude Instant 2.1 for expedited response times. Contextual Enrichment: Amazon Bedrock Titan was instrumental in embedding the FAQ sheet, augmenting responses with contextual understanding. Data Management and Authentication: Amazon DynamoDB facilitated data storage for session management and contextualization of user queries. The chatbot adeptly managed two distinct user personas: guest users and registered customers, with authentication handled via backend APIs using CustomerID. 2. Data Pipeline: FAQ Management: A robust data pipeline was established to manage FAQs stored on Vector DB deployed on Amazon EKS, ensuring continuous updates without disrupting chatbot functionality. Customer API Integration: Another pipeline was created to interact with Customer APIs, retrieving crucial details such as payment dates and due dates specific to a user. LLM-based Key Work and Improvements: Model Enhancement: The switch from Claude 2.1 to Claude Instant significantly improved response times, enhancing overall user experience. Parameter Tuning and Refinement: Parameter tuning and the addition of XML tags and placeholders within prompts refined response generation, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant answers. Custom Logic Implementation: A bespoke logic was developed to enable agents to discern whether a query should be addressed through FAQ or necessitated a customer API call, resulting in optimized response times. Admin Control Options: Administrators were provided with parameter tuning options through API headers, granting control over parameters such as Top P, token length, and temperature for tailored chatbot responses. This chatbot is designed to answer queries related to fintech and based on the knowledge base vector DB. We have implemented custom guardrails approach to handle situation where end-users were asking irrelevant questions, example: How to make a lemonade?, Who is the Prime Minister of India etc. We have implemented few shot prompting to make the response more appealing to the customer that ensures that response is polite and graceful and does not add statements such as “based on context”, “based on API response” in the final outcome. Implemented Vectorization method while storing the data in VectorDB to ensure smooth and faster data retrieval. We have also enabled ranking and filtering based on similarity threshold values and metadata stored in VectorDB. AWS Services: Amazon S3 Amazon Bedrock Amazon API Gateway AWS Lambda Amazon DynamoDB Amazon EKS Amazon VPC Amazon EC2 Amazon ECR Reaping Rewards: With rapid response generation clocking in at an impressive 2-3 seconds, users experienced minimal wait times, significantly enhancing overall user experience. Fibe chatbot is now handling more than 4 lakh conversation and over 5 Million user base, having ~10 messages on average per conversation. This chatbot has streamlined and automated 95% of the agent based chat for dynamic queries. The enhanced chatbot with its accurate responses for the end users, resulted in 15% reduction in the number of agent conversation made to the agents than before, hence contributing to saving operational cost close to 200K USD. Implementation ensured better maintenance of the knowledge base and an easy-to-update pipeline, further optimizing resource utilization, and reducing operational overheads for the customer.

case_study,Neogrowth Significant Increase in Performance & Cost Savings With AWS,"Neogrowth Significant Increase in Performance & Cost Savings With AWS Team Rapyder March 11, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Neogrowth Significant Increase in Performance & Cost Savings With AWS The Client Founded in 2012 and an ISO 9001:2015 certified player in the SME digital lending space, NeoGrowth is a Mumbai-based platform with a PAN India presence. Registered with the RBI, the organization’s approach includes innovative technology, a digital payment ecosystem, and flexible payment options. This fintech case study about NeoGrowth’s mission is to have a positive social impact on the ﬁnancial lives of SMEs by leveraging the digital payments ecosystem. With over 1,000 employees across 29 branches along with 2000+ channel partners, and over 17,000 customers, NeoGrowth serves industries such as F & B, hospitality, healthcare and pharma, automobile, and apparel. Digital Lending The MSME sector certainly has high growth potential, but securing funds from banks to fuel its growth has always been challenging. With banks demanding collaterals and imposing several restrictions, SMEs could not run smoothly. However, in the recent past, with technological advancements, several ﬁntech organizations are encouraging new entrepreneurs in the sector by enabling easy access to ﬁnance with digital lending platforms. NeoGrowth is one such platform striving to bridge the credit gap of MSMEs and offers customized products to address multiple business needs of customers. More than before, with Covid 19 pandemic, SMEs are playing a bigger role in the nation’s economic growth, and platforms such as NeoGrowth are also seeing an increase in demand for their services. Business Need As customers increased, efﬁciency, scalability, and continuous delivery became priorities driving NeoGrowth to adopt the scalability of microservices architecture along with container orchestration. This would support its developers to bring their applications from the development to the production stage at record speed and provide scalability and ﬂexibility of their applications. As an existing customer of Rapyder Cloud Solutions for managing its applications on the cloud AWS cloud platform, NeoGrowth, however, was still running microservices on a couple of static servers where-in each task demanded varying amounts of memory and CPU, leading to performance inefﬁciencies. In the absence of accurate resource allocation, the limitation in the memory would negatively impact the entire application, leading to service delays. To address this challenge, NeoGrowth consulted Rapyder’s engineers to move to microservices-based architecture and container orchestration with AWS ECS. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with expertise and experience in successful cloud migration and managed services, completed the transition and deployment of container orchestration. The Solution Covid-19 has undoubtedly accelerated cloud adoption by several years. Companies are increasingly leveraging container technology to fast-track application development, deployment, and portability of apps across different platform infrastructures. Rapyder’s expert team of Cloud Architects conceptualized and stitched a powerful and customized solution around Amazon Web Services for the task. Rapyder’s team supported the smooth transition to the successful deployment of microservices-based architecture and AWS ECS enablement. The team ﬁrst made the shift to containerize the microservices architecture at NeoGrowth. Unlike the traditional static server deployment, with the application’s components and functions in a single instance, microservices architecture splits the application into multiple services that perform different functions, each with a different logical function. These microservices were then placed in containers. Container orchestration leverages tools and platforms to automate, manage and schedule workloads that are deﬁned by individual containers. Containerization of the application was then done, followed by container orchestration with the Amazon ECS platform to manage the entire life cycle. This container orchestration is supported in automating the scheduling, deployment, scaling, and overall management of containers across a ﬂeet of servers. Amazon ECS, being highly scalable with high performance, allowed developers to run effortlessly, scale containerized applications, and automatically reschedule containers if required. Rapyder’s team also supported the client in leveraging spot instances with AWS services, in an economically priced model with steep discount offers, for test and development. The Benefits Building and delivering software reliably are key to an organization’s success and positive business outcomes in a digital economy. Equally important is the visibility across and within the software coding and delivery processes to ensure high speed and scalability with demand. The transition to microservices-based architecture did not impact the running of the business. Developers could now work faster due to smaller code bases in microservices with lesser complexities and dependencies of functions, bringing about better operational efﬁciency. Code reviews and updates were done faster, and failures could be isolated without bringing the entire system. Moreover, developers could leverage different programming languages effortlessly. All these led to continuous delivery, thereby establishing higher productivity. Scalability was independent of each microservice where only the required component of an app could be This ensured optimization of resources making the whole process cost-efﬁcient. Leveraging spot instances that came with AWS economically priced model also helped in cost- optimization to a large Above all, the ease of use of Amazon ECS in itself was beneﬁcial.

case_study,Limechat Migrated Its Applications from AZURE to AWS,"Limechat Migrated Its Applications from AZURE to AWS Team Rapyder April 1, 2022 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Limechat Migrated Its Applications from AZURE to AWS Introduction: LimeChat is India’s first level-3 AI chatbot company. LimeChat’s focus on e-commerce internet-first brands increases online sales and conversions and reduces customer support costs by 50%. LimeChat’s smart chatbot offers customers personalized and contextual conversational experiences wherever they are in the buyer’s journey. With integrations across CRM software, store management platform, payments network, and logistics platforms, LimeChat take great care of customer interactions for its clients. Business Need: The Limechat hosted a helpdesk solution for customer support and Chatbot logic on Kubernetes Cluster on the Microsoft Azure Platform. However, it faced challenges in ongoing support while running on Azure and wanted to migrate the application to AWS Cloud for better Support and Manageability. Below were the requirements from Limechat A Separate isolated and secure environment is to be created on the AWS cloud. Earlier, Limechat hosted their Application on Kubernetes at Azure and wanted to use the same Kubernetes platform on AWS. Limechat wanted to have secure, reliable, and scalable Infrastructure at AWS. At Azure, Limechat was using Instances with small configurations for PostgreSQL and Redis as they had separate PostgreSQL and Redis Databases for every end customer. At AWS, it needed a single PostgreSQL and Redis Database with a powerful configuration. It was looking forward to seamless migration with no data loss and with very minimal downtime. Limechat wanted to use AWS-managed services wherever possible. Implementation To address the objectives defined Business Need section, Rapyder worked with Limechat and came up with AWS Cloud Deployment Architecture for implementation. As Limechat was using Kubernetes on Azure, it recommended using AWS Managed Orchestration Service – Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). We applied the AWS best practices and business continuity principles and followed through the implementation as explained below: Considering end-customer demographic locations, AWS Mumbai Region was selected. A separate network with a combination of VPC/ Subnets was created as per AWS best practices. All the servers and Databases were hosted in a private subnet, thus eliminating direct access to the application, resulting in additional application security. AWS Managed Kubernetes Service – AWS EKS was used to host containerized microservice-based Applications. Scalability is considered at both levels, i.e., at the Worker node level (auto-scaling group) and POD level. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL is implemented in MultiAZ for High availability. For Data Security, encryption is considered. In Transit: using Lets Encrypt SSL At Rest: EBS and S3 Data encryption using AWS KMS AWS managed Service – Elasticache for Redis was implemented as an in-memory Database. AWS Services: AWS Managed Kubernetes Service – Amazon EKS, Application Load Balancer (ALB), NAT Gateway, Amazon RDS PostgreSQL, Amazon Elasticache for Redis, Amazon Cloudwatch, Amazon SNS, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon S3, IAM, AWS Config, AWS KMS. Third-Party Solution None Reaping Rewards: With this solution, we provided a Secure, Reliable, and Scalable Infrastructure on AWS EKS, offering High Availability. With the Rapyder team’s assistance, Limechat could Migrate to AWS Cloud with minimal downtime and zero data loss. Enterprise-grade RDS PostgreSQL in MultiAZ provides the expected performance. AWS managed Elasticache for Redis in high availability and boosted customer application performance by providing sub-millisecond response time. Using AWS Managed Services like RDS and Elasticache for Redis also released Infrastructure Management overhead from Limechat’s shoulders.

case_study,Biryani by Kilo’s Achieved Incredible ROI & Customer Experience Migration To AWS Cloud,"Biryani by Kilo’s Achieved Incredible ROI & Customer Experience Migration To AWS Cloud Team Rapyder March 21, 2022 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Biryani by Kilo’s Achieved Incredible ROI & Customer Experience Migration To AWS Cloud About the client Gurugram-based food-tech start-up, Biryani by Kilo (BBK), launched in 2015, has today expanded its reach across 30 cities in India with around 70 outlets and continues to grow exponentially. It offers Biryani to the masses and uses the best ingredients, including expensive branded rice, spices handpicked from Kerala, and stringently selected meats and vegetables for its Biryani and Kebabs. This cloud-kitchen start-up aims to grow to 200 plus outlets across India in the next two years and expand to international destinations, with an estimated Rs. 500 crore annual revenue by then. Client’s challenge and the business need BBK’s fast growth is driven by its increasing number of customers and expanding footprint. Although the organization had migrated to AWS Cloud from running on a Private Cloud, it faced several operations and customer service challenges. In addition, due to the inaccurate configuration of the AWS Cloud architecture, BBK’s business-critical infrastructure was impacted. Customers’ orders from food aggregators such as Zomato and Swiggy were getting missed at the outlets due to intermittent server outages, thereby losing crucial business and spoiling the customer’s experience. This challenge worsened when there was a significant spike in order volume during weekends, holidays, and special days, such as Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve. Database optimization was another area that had to be addressed. Cloud Security was another area that needed to be addressed, as the organization was using payment gateways for food orders. High availability and scaling of cloud infrastructure were required, without which the business functions could suffer. The client was unhappy with their AWS partner and was looking for a more experienced partner who could help them derive the proper benefits of AWS and help solve their issues. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with expertise and experience in successful cloud migration services, proposed a new solution to address all the above challenges. Rapyder’s team of Cloud Architects had several discovery sessions with the client to understand the latter’s requirement for implementing AWS Cloud. Then, they conceptualized and stitched a powerful, robust, and customized solution around AWS services for the task. Rapyder implemented the following proposed solution for a successful implementation of AWS Cloud. Rapyder re-configured the cloud architecture and ensured successful migration to the re-architected AWS cloud environment to suit the growing requirements of the organization. Being content heavy with videos and pictures of the dishes, these files were stored and continuously running across the network. They could be accessed by mobile phones even in Tier 2 cities from a 2G network too. AWS CloudFront was leveraged to deliver content continuously across all networks and geographies. Downtime challenges was addressed to contain business and customer losses, with all orders to the organization across touchpoints getting executed. Overall security of the infrastructure, covering payment gateways and all other security parameters, such as information and data security, was achieved. CloudWatch was leveraged to monitor the infrastructure, and proactive measures were taken to address issues. Database optimization was established with all DB layer parameters put in place. Availability and Scalability aspects were established in this new-architected infrastructure. All Applications and Databases were migrated to AWS cloud during non-peak hours with minimum downtime not affecting business operations. The entire solution that was stitched and implemented met the criteria of Security best practices. Business benefits With the significant reduction in downtime, the high volume of food orders placed was attended to and served, increasing business and ROI. Content delivery through videos was achieved, leading to smooth business transactions across all outlets in Tier I and Tier 2 cities and from 2G, 3G, or 4G networks, thereby enhancing customer experience. Cloud Infrastructure performance improved as a highly available and scalable architecture was provided at all the layers with the deployment. Employing AWS services such as self-managed EC2 instances and leveraging auto-scaling observed significant cost savings. Ease of management of applications and optimal performance was achieved with the migration. The migration of applications and databases was completed with negligible downtime with no impact on the business. Currently, the Cloud Infrastructure is maintained 24X7 by Rapyder, with BBK also signing up for the Managed Services. QUOTE: This biryani startup case study appreciating the effort Rapyder team, Kaushik Roy, Head of BBK, said, “The Rapyder team of Cloud experts was able to zero down on the several issues present in the old Cloud Architecture to create a stable and secure environment. Now, we can provide a better customer experience, where orders are not missed with a faster turn-around time of service delivery being achieved as well.” He added, “We have also signed up for Rapyder’s ongoing Managed Services to monitor and manage the Cloud Infrastructure.” Case Studies Download Case Studies Share Search Case Studies Recent Case Studies NIMF Achieves 50% Cost Savings with Saasification of Their Desktop Application January 17, 2025 Rapyder Enabled 100x Engineers to Successfully Implement Automation on AWS Cloud with a Modern Infrastructure Approach December 16, 2024 Rapyder’s Chatbot Resolves 95% of Queries with Ease and Precision November 18, 2024 Categories Migration Pinpoint Modernization Managed Services Gen-AI End-User Computing DevOps Database Migration Data Analytics/Machine Learning All Categories Articles Blogs Case Studies Cloud Optimization Cloud Security Cost Optimization Resources Data Analytics/Machine Learning Database Migration DevOps End-User Computing Events Gen-AI Managed Services Migration Modernization Pinpoint Tags All Tags AWS Ecommerce/Retail EdTech Financial Services FinTech Healthcare IoT IT/ITES Manufacturing Media & Entertainment Travel/Visa Firm Subscribe to the latest insights Subscribe to the latest insights Email Submit PrevPrevious NextNext Related Case Studies NIMF Achieves 50% Cost Savings with Saasification of Their Desktop Application Read More Rapyder Enabled 100x Engineers to Successfully Implement Automation on AWS Cloud with a Modern Infrastructure Approach Read More Rapyder’s Chatbot Resolves 95% of Queries with Ease and Precision Read More By Team Rapyder Get in Touch!

Medi Assist offers health benefits administration services, including cashless claims management, reimbursements, pharmacy benefits, planned hospitalization, and a host of outpatient services to corporates and individuals under the brand name of MediBuddy. MediBuddy is an award-winning technology platform that transforms the health insurance industry at the very core. Customer Business Needs: Medi Assist was running their TPA production workloads on-premise, consisting of a combination of Linux and Windows-based environments. Mediassist customer base is increasing rapidly, and they needed a public cloud platform that could scale according to the user traffic without any manual intervention or delays in infrastructure procurement. Business Solution: Rapyder worked with Mediassist to assess their current application and infrastructure landscape, and a detailed plan was created for migrating their applications to AWS concerning cost, security, and scalability. As part of this, around 25 applications running across 70+ servers were migrated in a lift-and-shift fashion to AWS. Also, high-traffic facing applications were deployed across availability zones with autoscaling to ensure high availability. Solution Provided To The Customer: Implemented a robust approach for deployments, rollbacks, and database replication for all the applications. Connectivity from AWS to on-premise was established using a site-to-site VPN. Palo Alto Firewall was deployed in high availability across Availability zones from AWS Marketplace for gateway firewall services. Route53 was used for the DNS configuration. All Software licenses required for SQL Server were brought into AWS under the BYOL agreement, reducing migration costs significantly. Servers were set up in MultiAZ High Availability/Cluster structure. Microsoft Active Directory was hosted in a shared account of AWS and will be synced with On-Prem AD. AWS LCM was used for backup (AMI) with the RTO and RPO requirements of the customer. The Rapyder team has suggested recommendations based on Well-Architected Review, which will be remediated soon, along with Mediassist. AWS Services Used: EC2, ALB, S3, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Guard Duty, Config, EFS, FSX, Data Sync, KMS, Cloud Endure, Systems Manager Third-party Solution: Palo alto firewall Business Benefits: The entire migration was completed within 2 months with near-zero downtime. With the migration to AWS, the infrastructure spends reduced overall, moving from Capex to Opex with savings of around 20%. There was a significant improvement in the performance of the applications. The operating model of AWS helped to manage the infrastructure better.

With over 1,000 employees across 29 branches along with 2000+ channel partners and over 17,000 customers, Alluvium-IoT serves industries such as F&B, hospitality, healthcare and pharma, automobile, apparel, and many others. The Business Need As customers increased, efficiency, scalability, and continuous delivery became a priority, driving Alluvium-IoT to shift to microservices architecture and container orchestration. This would support its developers to bring their applications from the development to the production stage at record speed in addition to providing scalability and flexibility of their applications. As an existing customer of Rapyder Cloud Solutions for managing its applications on the cloud AWS cloud platform, Alluvium-IoT, however, was still running an old-school, standalone monolithic application for various tasks, where each task demanded varying amounts of memory and CPU, leading to performance inefficiencies. In the absence of accurate resource allocation, the limitation in the memory would negatively impact the entire application, leading to service delays. To address this challenge, Alluvium-IoT consulted Rapyder’s engineers to move to microservices-based architecture and container orchestration with AWS ECS.

case_study,"Bewakoof.com Migrates to AWS Cloud, Achieved Performance & Cost Reduction of 30%","Bewakoof.com Migrates to AWS Cloud, Achieved Performance & Cost Reduction of 30% Team Rapyder March 12, 2021 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Bewakoof.com Migrates to AWS Cloud, Achieved Performance & Cost Reduction of 30% About The Client Bewakoof.com is a direct-to-consumer online apparel company with a fast-growing and robust customer base since its inception in 2012. It has grown to become a successful business and lifestyle brand with an annual turnover of Rs. 210 crores in FY 2019-20. The company believes in improving the customer experience, product design, and supply chain processes through technological innovation. With a current employee strength of over 250, Bewakoof has sold more than one crore of products. Its app has over 60 lakh downloads and continues to grow by the hour. Bewakoof aims to become a household brand, cross Rs.1,000 in revenues by 2024, and leverage technology to drive the scale. The Business Need Bewakoof.com was earlier running its workloads in GCP, which was deployed and managed by its internal team. However, with Bewakoof’s focus on business growth and scale, its management moved the workloads and entire operations to AWS cloud, given the latter’s reliability, the numerous managed services, and the efﬁcient cost structure offerings. It wanted to leverage the AWS cloud suite to power its platform backend, marketing tech, and data services. Bewakoof was exploring a suitable and reliable partner to support them in migrating and deploying the workloads seamlessly onto AWS, with minimal downtime. The Client also wanted to ensure that best practices were being followed along with associated cost beneﬁts and no data loss. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with expertise and experience in successful cloud migration services, was chosen by the Client to help move the workloads to AWS Cloud. The Solution Rapyder’s team of Cloud Architects had several discovery sessions with the Client to understand the latter’s requirement for migration to AWS Cloud. The team then conceptualized and stitched a robust and customized solution around AWS services for the migration. The following proposed solution was implemented by Rapyder for a successful migration to AWS while ensuring that best practices and business continuity principles were also applied: EKS cluster in AWS was conﬁgured to setup the application on AWS. The CICD pipeline was built using native AWS services to ensure business continuity, faster go-to-market, and integration with other AWS services. The migration activity was completed within the agreed time frame with the Client. Automated threat detection was implemented using AWS GuardDuty, an ML-based threat detection service that helps identify malicious activities and unauthorized behavior to protect AWS accounts, workload, and data. The Benefits The pandemic and other factors that contributed to the ﬂuctuation of the market also impacted the operational and storage needs of the IT infrastructure in general. By applying business continuity principles and best practices in moving the workloads to AWS Cloud, the Rapyder team brought about a signiﬁcant increase in performance and cost efﬁciency, The cloud cost was reduced by 30 percent, and in the long term, the migration is likely to bring down the cost by a signiﬁcant 15-20 The operational overheads were reduced signiﬁcantly by leveraging the managed services of AWS, such as ElastiCache. Enabled to scale quickly to handle the unexpected spikes in trafﬁc, as and when the need arises. Cost efﬁciency was also achieved by using AMD-based instances on AWS. Application release management was made seamless with building the CICD process for the application running on EKS, thereby ensuring business. The process that was built using native AWS tools ensured better integrations with other AWS services. The migration will drive the platform’s growth by adding more capabilities and SKUs, leading to an increase in the number of monthly visitors. It will help the brand to go regional by enabling the designing of products that align with the cultural and regional ethos besides the region-speciﬁc weather conditions. This will require data streaming, analysis, and quick decision-making that are enabled with the AWS cloud. By leveraging AWS-managed services and deep tech support, Bewakoof can provide an enhanced user experience and customization at scale.

case_study,"NMIMS Cuts Costs by 28%, Up in Performance By Migrate from Azure To AWS","NMIMS Cuts Costs by 28%, Up in Performance By Migrate from Azure To AWS Team Rapyder March 9, 2021 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> NMIMS Cuts Costs by 28%, Up in Performance By Migrate from Azure To AWS About The Client Established in 1981, Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS) is a deemed-to-be University of global repute and a leading name for Management education in India. It is striving to become a globally admired university by 2030. NMIMS prides itself on consistently maintaining high-quality academic and research work with top national and global faculty members. Today, it has grown to 107 schools and 16 disciplines. At the highest level, national bodies, such as NAAC and NBA, accredit this multidisciplinary and multi-campus (across cities) institution. AACSB accredits its management institution, and AMBA accredits its Bengaluru and Hyderabad programs. The NMIMS academic infrastructure is at par with the best in the world today. The Business Need NMIMS was running its Learning Management System (LMS) workload on Microsoft Azure. It was run on a single server with challenges related to application performance besides incurring very high costs. LMS, being crucial in course creation and managing administration, tracking, reporting, and delivery of courses, its performance and cost-effectiveness were top priorities for the institution. The client was exploring a more suitable cloud computing service provider to address the existing challenges and signed up with a partner who could support the migration process. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with expertise and experience in successful cloud migration services, was chosen by the client for migration and implementation. The Solution Rapyder’s expert team of Cloud Architects had several discovery sessions with the client and did a complete analysis to understand the latter’s requirement for the migration. This was followed by Rapyder’s team conceptualizing and stitching a powerful and customized solution around AWS services for the task. The team helped migrate the client’s application from Azure to AWS, tested them on the new location, and consolidated all the web applications on AWS. The robust solution configured and implemented by Rapyder’s team for a successful migration to AWS is captured below: Having understood the need for future scaling on the cloud infrastructure, the Web and DB layers were split to facilitate scaling at a later stage and avoid any single-point failure. Application Load Balancers supporting content-based routing and applications running in containers were placed in front of the web layer as the first line of defense. It also provides additional visibility into the health of the target instances and containers and takes care of bad requests coming from the users. Custom metrics were configured on each server to track the utilization of all the infrastructure metrics. Amazon GuardDuty, the threat detection service, was implemented to intelligently monitor for malicious activities of the AWS account at the network level. Finally, a dry run was performed to ensure the application migration was successful. The Benefits The entire migration from Azure cloud to AWS cloud was done within 2 weeks, with the business up and running soon. This migration of the workload resulted in better response times for the application. The cost was 28% lower with AWS compared to the previous platform’s running cost.

case_study,Dizbi Achieved A Safe & Secure Environment By Migrating To AWS Cloud,"Dizbi Achieved A Safe & Secure Environment By Migrating To AWS Cloud Team Rapyder August 24, 2020 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Dizbi Achieved A Safe & Secure Environment By Migrating To AWS Cloud About The Client DIZBI is a digital product and services private limited company in Bengaluru, India. Dizbi is the technology arm of PDS Multinational Group, which has an annual turnover of 1.2 billion USD with its presence in 18 nations. Given Dizbi’s rich technology experience in developing enterprise frameworks, processes, and excellent resources, it has enabled the digital transformation journey of many enterprises with the philosophy of design thinking and applied thought. Dizbi, hereafter referred to as “Customer.” Customer Business Need: The customer acquired a company known as “Collective Heads.” Employees working under Collective Heads were also moved to work under Customer payroll. While these new users need to work on new projects, the customer wanted to have a safe & secure environment so that data privacy & security rules are intact while these new users are added to the system. They also wanted minimal operational overhead in maintaining the system. Below are the requirements from the customer: A separate isolated and secure remote workplace solution & avoid users connecting to their on-premises workspaces. When users need to work on development projects, they still need secure access to the applications/data deployed in the customer’s own data center. A highly secure and reliable solution that would keep their data safe & secure from any theft or loss. A centralized identity management system is in place to track & manage access smoothly. The solution should also serve as a contingency plan for their business continuity in case their premises are not accessible due to some unavoidable reasons. Solution: Our AWS Certified Solutions Architects conducted detailed workshop sessions with the customer to understand their existing setup, challenges, and requirements. We also captured remote users’ licensing and software requirements in the discovery. The following solution approach was proposed and implemented with best practices and business continuity principles and then migrated their production workload to AWS. AWS Workspaces was proposed as it is a highly reliable managed service with minimal operational overhead. A separate network with a combination of VPC / Subnets was created as per the best practices. All the workspaces were launched in private subnets & endpoints accessible through the Internet. AWS & Customer Data Centre was connected using AWS site-to-site VPN tunnel for establishing connectivity required between AWS Workspaces & On-Prem Data/applications. The workspaces were integrated with a self-managed Active Directory hosted on AWS EC2 for authentication with an AD connector. Workspaces were also hardened according to the requirement of the customer. Office & Anti-Virus packages were provided by the customer & included in the image to launch Workspaces. Installation packages for other agent-based software required were also included in the image. All traffic from the Internet has been routed through the site-to-site VPN tunnel to access the Internet and applications. Restricted policies were applied to prevent any data movement between AWS Workspaces & User-machine. Both web-based and client-based applications were configured as part of this setup. AWS Cloudtrail will be configured for tracking the API Calls. AWS Cloudwatch was configured for monitoring various matrices of the setup. AWS Services: AWS Workspaces, Directory Service, NAT Gateway, VPN, Config, S3, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, IAM Third-Party Solution: None Business Benefits: AWS workspaces solve customers’ need for business continuity for all users. With this solution, we were able to provide a secure and reliable remote workplace option for the user set separate from the existing setup. AWS VPN connectivity between AWS & On-Prem data center helped AWS workspaces communicate with applications & data residing on-prem with low latency. Data copy restrictions were applied from AWS Workspaces to users’ machines to safeguard data from theft & loss. AD setup enabled the customer to have standard identity management for their users in AWS Workspaces. To optimize the size of the AWS infra as per the actual size, conducted an infra audit post-implementation support period. Data stored is maintained, and automated backups are ensured by performing regular Data Backup/Restore drills. About Rapyder Rapyder is an agile, innovative company that makes Cloud work for you.

case_study,Tix Technologies Migrates to AWS Cloud with Rapyder,"Tix Technologies Migrates to AWS Cloud with Rapyder Team Rapyder December 15, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Tix Technologies Migrates to AWS Cloud with Rapyder About The Client TIX was founded in 2009 with the single goal of making live events more affordable in Australia. They achieved this by launching Lasttix – a destination for discount ticket offers to theatres, concerts, musicals, and more. Fast forward 10 years, and they have expanded their goal also to make live entertainment more accessible and have done this by launching the TIX app, which, in one straightforward interface, helps its users instantly identify the best ticket prices no matter where they are or what their budget is. TIX now operates in 4 countries with over 1.6 million members. The Business Need CUSTOMER had developed a .NET application for a ticket-selling product, built using Windows Stack, and wanted to host this application on the Cloud. After discussions with the Rapyder team of Cloud engineers, they decided to go with AWS to benefit from the flexibility of Infrastructure sizing and to have a Scalable infrastructure along with High Availability for their different components, as they were expecting massive traffic on the platform. They also wanted to have CI/CD pipelines for each of their application components. The Solution To address the business objectives that needed to be achieved, Rapyder implemented a solution on AWS that, considering the future growth expected, provided Tix Technologies with a flexible and scalable environment: The application has UI, API, and DB layers. All the servers were launched in a private subnet to prevent the servers from being exposed to the public directly. High availability was factored in, and servers were launched in HA mode across different availability zones. UI and API layers were deployed in Auto-scaling groups behind the Application Load Balancer to meet the scaling demand of the Customer. MSSQL enterprise edition was used as DB to run the database in Always-On mode so that high availability would be taken care of. AWS-managed Microsoft AD was implemented, and all the servers made part of the AD to manage authentication centrally. Servers using IAM roles to access the services like S3 and Cloudwatch. IAM users created and only required access provided by using IAM policies. Custom metrics were set up on all servers, and monitoring was enabled by using Cloudwatch. Cloudwatch alarms were also created for CPU, Memory, and Disk Utilization. Antivirus was installed on each server to protect the servers from malware attacks.

They achieved this by launching Lasttix – a destination for discount ticket offers to theatres, concerts, musicals, and more. Fast forward 10 years, and they have expanded their goal also to make live entertainment more accessible and have done this by launching the TIX app, which, in one straightforward interface, helps its users instantly identify the best ticket prices no matter where they are or what their budget is. TIX now operates in 4 countries with over 1.6 million members. The Business Need CUSTOMER had developed a .NET application for a ticket-selling product, built using Windows Stack, and wanted to host this application on the Cloud. After discussions with the Rapyder team of Cloud engineers, they decided to go with AWS to benefit from the flexibility of Infrastructure sizing and to have a Scalable infrastructure along with High Availability for their different components, as they were expecting massive traffic on the platform. They also wanted to have CI/CD pipelines for each of their application components. The Solution To address the business objectives that needed to be achieved, Rapyder implemented a solution on AWS that, considering the future growth expected, provided Tix Technologies with a flexible and scalable environment: The application has UI, API, and DB layers. All the servers were launched in a private subnet to prevent the servers from being exposed to the public directly. High availability was factored in, and servers were launched in HA mode across different availability zones. UI and API layers were deployed in Auto-scaling groups behind the Application Load Balancer to meet the scaling demand of the Customer. MSSQL enterprise edition was used as DB to run the database in Always-On mode so that high availability would be taken care of. AWS-managed Microsoft AD was implemented, and all the servers made part of the AD to manage authentication centrally. Servers using IAM roles to access the services like S3 and Cloudwatch. IAM users created and only required access provided by using IAM policies. Custom metrics were set up on all servers, and monitoring was enabled by using Cloudwatch. Cloudwatch alarms were also created for CPU, Memory, and Disk Utilization. Antivirus was installed on each server to protect the servers from malware attacks. AWS CloudFormation is used for spinning up the entire infrastructure. CI/CD pipelines have been set up for each application component. AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy were used for CI and CD. Jenkins hosted on EC2 machine. AWS Guard Duty was enabled, and a custom solution was developed using lambda scripts to take action on the findings.

case_study,Neogrowth’s ROI of 30% With a Fully Automated CI/CD Solution,"Neogrowth’s ROI of 30% With a Fully Automated CI/CD Solution Team Rapyder November 29, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Neogrowth’s ROI of 30% With a Fully Automated CI/CD Solution About The Client Neogrowth is a pioneer in lending based on the underwriting of digital payment data. It is a NBFC registered with RBI organization and started commercial operations in 2013. The company’s proprietary technology platform offers unsecured loans to merchants who accept customers’ cards and other digital payments. By far, Neogrowth has partnered with 13000+ business merchants to help them grow their businesses. Their mission is to have a positive social impact on the financial lives of small & medium business merchants across India. More than 50% of these merchants are creditworthy but have been excluded from accessing loans based on traditional underwriting methods. The Business Need As an organization that provides loans to SMEs, maintaining a proper customer relation and interaction base is a huge requirement. Hence, the client was developing an internal CRM application for which they performed manual deployments in their environment. This made the development process highly prone to human error, reduced efficiency, and affected the code quality. Developers at Neogrowth were logging into the production servers, which was a major security risk for the organization. With these pain points: Overall development time increased with backlogs of non-critical errors. The process did not allow optimal utilization of resources. Coding process was prone to human error, and rectifying changes was causing unintended consequences. The Solution The client was using GitHub as their version control system for which AWS Code Pipelines were implemented for each environment that would get triggered whenever any commit was made to the corresponding branch of the GitHub repository. As soon as the code was committed, Code Pipeline would get triggered, pulling the code from the repository and triggering the Jenkins build. Jenkins was used to validate the config variables. Hence, in any scenario of any variable missing, the entire build would fail. For any deployment failures, Code Deploy Rollbacks were implemented to deploy the previously stable running version of the application. Upon successful build, AWS Code Deploy would get triggered and Deploy the artifacts to the target servers. The Benefits Cloud experts at Rapyder provided the whole solution in just two weeks, in which the right solution and configuration that could support the seamless functioning of the application were designed to achieve the desired results. Benefits that Neogrowth witnessed were: With a fully automated CI/CD solution, any scope of human-prone errors was removed, which increased the development cycle. With automation in the development cycle, the time to market this CRM application was reduced to 40%. The client witnessed an ROI of 30%. As the development lifecycle was automated, developers now spend more time on development than operations.

Our cloud experts stitched a solution with AWS services, and the following solutions were implemented: A VPN connection from AWS to Azure account was provisioned for seamless connectivity. The NoSQL database was extended into AWS, considering the vast amount of data to be transferred. The search engine of the application had terabytes of data in the clusters of AWS by extending the clusters into AWS, which ensured zero downtime. All other servers were created in a private subnet only to be accessed within a VPC for security with a load balancer. The NoSQL database and search engine cluster were deployed across availability zones for HA. Open VPN server was provisioned to connect directly to the instances in private servers locally. NAT gateway was used for all outgoing internet connections from private servers. Reserved instances recommendations helped in reducing the cost further after. The Benefits Considering the timeline requested by the client, the entire migration, including the database of 5 TB, was completed within 10 days. After migrating the entire application to AWS, the client recognized a cost saving of almost 25% compared to the expenses paid on Azure. The solution provided is highly available and scalable at all application layers.

case_study,Rapyder Migrates a Ride-Sharing Startup from GCP to AWS,"Rapyder Migrates a Ride-Sharing Startup from GCP to AWS Team Rapyder November 25, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Rapyder Migrates a Ride-Sharing Startup from GCP to AWS The Challenge The Customer was running multiple workloads on the Google Cloud Platform and had planned to migrate their entire B2C application from GCP to AWS. These were Java-based applications to cater to their customer-facing mobile app APIs with Backend Database as MySQL. This migration was expected to be done with very minimal downtime of maximum 30 minutes. The Solution Consultants at Rapyder had detailed discussions with the Client to understand their requirements and studied the working of their application portfolio to provide an optimum solution for the migration. To address the objectives defined in the statement of work, our Solution Architects stitched the solution around AWS services. The following solution was implemented: AWS Mumbai region was considered for the hosting of applications. All the servers behind the application load balancers were provisioned in private subnets in different AZ, which was behind the load balancer. Load balancer would offload the SSL certificate and send traffic to the appropriate instance. Public-facing servers were launched in a public subnet based on the requirement. OpenVPN server was provisioned to connect directly to the instances in private servers from local. RDS MySQL with Read replica was configured for Database. AWS ACM used for SSL certificates to be applied on the load balancer. ElasticSearch was provisioned to be used as managed service and was replicated to AWS by backup and restore. RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ were configured on EC2. NAT Gateway was used for all outgoing internet connections from private servers. AWS CloudTrail is enabled to monitor activity on the AWS account. AWS CloudWatch setup is done by monitoring the servers. Route53 will be used as DNS Service for weighted routing between GCP and AWS before routing 100% of traffic to AWS. Database Migration was used for migration as the Customer had a very slim window for the cut-over to production. The Outcome Highly available and very scalable architecture has been provisioned at all layers. The Client is expecting huge growth in its customer base year-on-year, and with the infrastructure provisioned by Rapdyer, they are now well-prepared to meet the challenges of the near future.

The management of HotelHub was also looking for a platform on which they could innovate their business solutions faster. The Solution Our AWS-certified Solutions Architects conducted multiple rounds of discussions with HotelHub and developed a proposal that would best fulfill the Customer’s requirements. Best practices and business continuity principles were applied to the solution, and the following considerations/ Architecture Approach was taken: AWS Ireland was chosen as the region for hosting, keeping in mind their customer base.

Both Web and API layers were highly available, with multiple servers running behind the load balancer. Static servers were used at both the App and UI layers, considering the predictive nature of traffic on the application. MySQL was set up on EC2 instances across AZs for High Availability. Custom automation was written for the auto-failover of MySQL instances. The MS SQL standard was also run on EC2 in mirroring mode across AZ for high availability. Failover of the DB was also automated and tested by leveraging Route53 private hosted zone with Lambda, which was configured to update the DNS in case of failover. Microsoft Active Directory was hosted in two AZs for high availability and synced with on-premises AD. Site-to-site VPN connection with on-premises to send the logs to Splunk for log analysis. Native backups were set up on the database setups and configured to go to AWS S3. AWS Services EC2, Lambda, CloudWatch, Guard Duty, AWS Config, S3 Third-Party Services SQL Server, Ncache, Symantec Antivirus, Splunk The Benefits Today, the migrated workloads are running successfully on AWS without any downtimes.

case_study,Extramarks Achieves 15% ROI by Leveraging AWS Auto Scaling,"Extramarks Achieves 15% ROI by Leveraging AWS Auto Scaling Team Rapyder October 7, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Extramarks Achieves 15% ROI by Leveraging AWS Auto Scaling About The Client Extramarks aims to transform the conventional education system by providing modern-day total learning digital solutions to students and teachers. With easy-to-understand, engaging content empowered by advanced technology, Extramarks effectively creates a bright, personalized, and interactive learning environment in the classroom and at home. With features like- Progress Tracker, Mentor Support, Study Scheduler, Group Work, and many more, this one-app-one solution is currently used by over 9000 schools across India, Singapore, Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, and South Africa. The Business Need ‘Extramarks’ interactive sessions provide deep, immersive learning through Learn-Practice-Test (LPT) Pedagogy. In this technology-driven time, Extramarks is constantly promoting independent learning for its stakeholders (parents, teachers & students) while maintaining continuity from school to home and ensuring effective communication among the stakeholders. However, over the years, their application was running on standalone servers in the public domain to handle the incoming load. This made them dependent on the central server and possessed many security issues, undoubtedly making the application vulnerable to attacks and malware. The client was looking to cater to three prime requirements: A solution that would automate their scaling. Secure its application from any kind of attacks and, Deploy their application at a faster pace. The Solution The Cloud Consultants at Rapyder designed the right solution and configuration that could support the seamless functioning of the application to overcome the challenges mentioned above. The consultants at Rapyder proposed the following solutions to achieve the desired results: The servers were migrated to private subnets to make the application secure. AWS WAF was implemented with CloudFront to tackle the vulnerabilities of the website. AWS Auto Scaling was implemented to handle the load based on the incoming load on the servers. OWASP WAF rules such as Cross Site Match Conditions, Size constraint conditions, SQL injection, IP Match Conditions, and String regex Match Conditions were implemented to prevent further vulnerabilities. For new deployments to the server running in Auto Scaling groups, a script was written that the client would deploy the application on one static server and then run the custom script by Rapyder. The script was designed to take the AMI of the server and deploy it on Auto Scaling Group, ensuring that the new application was running successfully. The Benefits With Rapyder’s consultation and the right solution, Extramarks achieved the desired results and scalability on their application. Here’s a lowdown of the benefits derived by them: Servers now on private subnets were no longer publicly accessible and restricted any unauthorized access, making the server secure. The client no longer needed to perform Manual Scaling. With the implementation of AWS Auto Scaling, Extramarks achieved an ROI of up to 15% on AWS cost. Our scheduled scaling at peak times made them witness further savings of 10%. CloudFront by AWS helped the client cache the content dynamically and made them leverage edge location for faster content delivery.

SquarePanda is an award-winning, edtech literacy platform and research-based phonics learning system for pre-readers and early readers worldwide. Equipped with this AI-based platform that assesses and engages learners, SquarePanda aims to empower all children to reach their full potential. Square Panda’s adaptive platform helps children globally, across skill sets and socio-economic backgrounds, to equip themselves with reading, writing, and communicative skills. The learning experience is joyful and based on innovative teaching practices. The Business Need The applications were already hosted on AWS in the US. However, with the new setup in India, SquarePanda wanted to expand its operations in India and China and implement the hosting of applications on AWS in these new geographical locations. The client wanted to address the business need for a faster go-to-market facility and deliver an enhanced customer experience that would be brought about with this implementation. It was looking for a partner who could provide them with an AWS solution for their application and ensure scalability, high availability, and security.

This led to the Customer looking for a solution that would improve its delivery and support of IT while lowering the total cost of ownership. The Solution To effectively address the business need of the Client, Rapyder’s team of Cloud Architects thoroughly studied the former’s requirement for implementation. A customized solution around AWS services was implemented while applying Cloud Deployment Architecture best practices and business continuity principles. Rapyder implemented the following proposed solution and architecture approach: In the new AWS infrastructure, all the servers were launched in private subnets for ease of administration and control, with most components deployed in multi-AZ configuration to avoid single-point failure. AWS-managed load balancer was used to balance the traffic across two availability zones. The balancer was configured to route all site traffic, including dynamic pages. AWS-managed NAT Gateway was used for any outbound traffic from servers in private subnets. Monitoring and alerts were set up on each server to monitor metrics like CPU, memory, and disk. Cloudtrail was enabled for all regions. CI/CD pipelines were set up for each application component, where AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy were used. The Benefits Time-to-market was significantly reduced by 30%, with high agility achieved. The new infrastructure was up and running in two weeks. No single point of failure was witnessed as the environment was running in high availability behind the load balancer.

The company offers retailers and brands a disruptive cloud solution enabling customers to find and order products and services online. The solution provides retailers with innovative store management and contextual visibility to improve profitability. It also connects stores with their consumers, facilitating the last-mile connection. The solution comprises a tablet, barcode scanner, thermal printer, and an intelligent external 22” consumer-facing LED display for visual consumer engagement. The Business Need According to Nielsen, India has over 6.65 million Kirana stores, contributing to nearly 90% of its total trade. The global pandemic has reinforced the importance of local Kirana stores and changed how these Kirana stores function. With the surge in demand, various demand and supply-related challenges have emerged. Social distancing and hygiene norms have made e-payment the new normal. Research suggests that the customers these stores won during the pandemic can only be retained if they offer home delivery, credit, hyper-local apps, and hyper-local merchandising services. SnapBizz has been working to organize and digitize these Kirana stores to improve their profitability. However, the need to digitize everything from stocks to payments has led to an unexpected surge in traffic, affecting the solution’s performance. The client wanted a solution that would address the following needs: Focus on business innovation, Automate scaling of the application to handle traffic, Lower their infrastructure cost, Improve application performance.

case_study,Rapyder Builds Infrastructure As Code Using Terraform,"Rapyder Builds Infrastructure As Code Using Terraform Team Rapyder September 15, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Rapyder Builds Infrastructure As Code Using Terraform About The Company The client started the business as a consultancy helping large companies run competitions in schools. It soon became evident, however, that data was the key to all things marketing. Incorporated as a Limited company in 1991, the company has been using data to help education suppliers market and sell effectively to schools and colleges. The Challenge The client sought a cloud-agnostic tool to orchestrate the infrastructure onto multiple public clouds (AWS, Azure). They wanted the infrastructure to be up in a few minutes. The client had different environments like production, staging, and QA to test. Database backups were also included as part of the infrastructure setup. The Solution DevOps engineers at Rapyder Cloud Solutions reviewed and analyzed the client’s requirement where the need was to orchestrate the infrastructure within a few minutes, and that also should be cloud agnostic. Engineers at Rapyder used Terraform to codify the provisioning of infrastructure onto the public cloud and enabled this provisioning to these clouds through automation. By automating manual configurations, we also eliminated the possibility of human error. The solution provided by Rapyder also took care of the database backup for the situation when the infrastructure is destroyed – automated backup of the database would be kicked off in that scenario. Not only infra but Rapyder also automated the application deployment process by integrating GitLab (an open source software) to improve software development and accelerate the software delivery. As a result, the client’s application could be brought up within no time and without human intervention. The client can now test their application and deploy it in the production environment without downtime using this solution. The client‘s time to market is significantly reduced. The solution allows the client to orchestrate the infra as and when needed. The Benefits The client can launch the infrastructure over multiple public clouds within a brief time (a matter of minutes).

case_study,AWS Managed Cloud Service Case Study: Travel Firm Achieved Cost Saving,"AWS Managed Cloud Service Case Study: Travel Firm Achieved Cost Saving Team Rapyder August 29, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> AWS Managed Cloud Service Case Study: Travel Firm Achieved Cost Saving About The Client Our Customer is a leader in the travel industry assisting its customers in making intelligent travel plans as a one-stop shopping place for all their travel needs. From a small travel agency more than 5 decades ago, they have expanded exponentially, becoming one of the largest travel companies in India with multiple offices worldwide. The Challenge Our Customer, already on AWS Cloud, was in an expansion phase. During peak hours and heavy workloads, their applications stopped responding to user requests leading to frequent service outages resulting in a potential revenue loss for the organization. With the internal teams not well versed with the Cloud technologies, the architecture was inefficient due to best practices not being followed, and there were limitations in dealing with simultaneous failures or traffic congestions. Also, performance optimization was tedious because there was no monitoring enabled for their PaaS service. The Solution After taking over the Managed Services, the AWS-certified engineers at Rapyder introduced several processes and procedures to assist in alleviating the Customer’s pain points: 24x7x365 Failure Response Process: Continuously monitoring, Online ticketing service, and alarms were handled directly by iNOC engineers, ultimately leading to fast response time. The monitoring system was set up on the cloud, based on the customer’s existing environment and demand to continuously monitor all applications in real-time, improving decision-making. Efficient architecture design: Re-Architected different application components to make them scalable and introduced Auto-heal concepts at AWS Cloud & client services level. Auto-scaling of app components was implemented. Centralized logging & Alerting system was put in place to identify application issues. The access mechanism was rectified to improve the security of the deployment process. Operational processes were streamlined for smoother operations on data access. Automation on build deployment was put in place. Implement a security framework to enable the development team to focus on the business prospectus and not on operational hazards. Creation of a fail-safe cloud operating environment by implementing scheduled backups and automatic restores in case of data loss. Audit trails are maintained for every activity performed on the infrastructure for operational transparency. The Benefits Since moving under the Rapyder Managed Services portfolio, the Customer’s average disruption time, which previously was 10 days in a Business year (approx. 97% SLA), was reduced to 52 minutes (approx. 99.99% SLA) in a Business year, thus making 99.99% of service availability a reality. The Customer could reliably operate their frequently growing workloads without system downtime or issues. Our Client reduced its monthly AWS infrastructure operating costs by 12%, consolidating idle resources and introducing AWS RI Model.

case_study,AWS DevOps Services Case Study – Implemented a CI/CD Pipeline on Tix,"AWS DevOps Services Case Study – Implemented a CI/CD Pipeline on Tix Team Rapyder August 29, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> AWS DevOps Services Case Study – Implemented a CI/CD Pipeline on Tix About The Client Tix is a ticket booking application based in Australia with a single goal of making live events more affordable & accessible. They take out the pain of searching different sources to find tickets and put them all in the palm of your hand with the TIX app. The application operates in 6 cities across 5 countries with over 1.60 million members & app users. The Challenge In this competitive era, every business aims to provide its customers with the best product and service in no time. TIX aims to create one platform where live entertainment can be affordable and more accessible. For this, the client was developing a B2C online booking application to be hosted on AWS cloud and had two prime requirements: They were looking for AWS expertise that would provide solutions on AWS and help them implement the entire Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with no manual intervention and auto rollbacks in the case of deployment failures with AWS services. A highly scalable and reliable architecture for their application. A CapEx-based solution instead of an OpEx for the application to change the application’s architecture later if needed. The Solution They were looking for AWS experts that would help them provide solutions for shortening their development cycle with reduced deployments and auto rollbacks. The client had 3 different environments, Dev, SIT, and Production Environment. For each pipeline, unique AWS CodePipelines were implemented for automated deployments. WebHooks were configured for each pipeline so that the pipelines would get triggered with every commit. AWS Parameter Store was used to store & secure the configuration data, which will be replaced at the time of deployment based on the environment. Jenkins was configured for MS builds which will push the binaries to AWS S3 to manage, organize and secure the data. A package manager server was also set up from where the application can download the Node and NuGet packages, not making it available to the public internet for downloading the packages. This, in return, reduced the build time. Code Deploy was used to deploy the artifact to the target servers to avoid downtime during the deployment. Notifications were set up at the pipeline level to notify clients about new deployments and failures. Rollbacks were configured; the previous stable version will be deployed in case of a failed deployment. CloudFormation scripts were written for infrastructure to replicate the architecture in a short period. AWS Architecture The Benefits The entire process for all the 3 environments was successfully implemented in the time frame of 1.5 months with full automation. After implementing the solutions provided by Rapyder, TIX witnessed sustainable results for their application development. Here’s a low down of benefits derived: With the help of CloudFormation, the developers could replicate the whole architecture and launch it in no time. A fully automated CI/CD solution eradicated the risk of manual-prone error entirely and fastened the development cycle. 30% of developers’ time is now invested in coding instead of manual deployments and resolving bugs. Manual implementation for a CI/CD solution would have taken around an hour, and de-bugging an error would take the whole day. But with a fully automated CI/CD solution, the process was completed in 10 minutes. The CloudFormation script (Infrastructure as Code) made the development and deployment process efficient, enabling faster go-to-market features.

They have personnel working in three shifts in a day to cater to their customers across the globe. The Business Need The users, when connecting from outside office, faced problems with access to their business applications – both performance slowness and access downtimes. The data also needed to be protected which was a critical thing with respect to DLP. The frequent bad user experience also led to a low towards IT. One prime area of concern was to ensure the security of their data, which had some increased risks when all users were field based. This led to the Customer looking for a solution that would improve its delivery and support of IT while lowering the total cost of ownership. The Solution Solution Architects at Rapyder carried out an assessment of the Customer’s environment & requirements and recommended that they move to a managed workspace environment. All users provisioned on AWS Workspace in the Singapore region. Hardened operating system environments were used as a secure base to package the applications. Identity and access management was established using identity federation back to the corporate Active Directory. Multiple security features included – WAF, USB lockdown, IP lockdown, copy & paste locked down. A VPN tunnel was established between AWS and their data center to allow their access to their enterprise applications. A highly resilient Amazon Workspaces platform was created, ensuring all services are placed across two different availability zones so that in the event of an AZ failure, the services automatically restart and will be available in an alternate zone. The Benefits Better management of infra-structure for optimal resource utilization and application performance. Users can work from anywhere and the company’s data stays on company systems. The new user setup is 75% faster than the old environment, and users are provisioned in as little as 30 minutes. Improved cost efficiency by systematically managing new hires, terminations, and changes, efficiently and effectively.

case_study,RupeeRedee Achieved 5X Capability by Migrating to AWS Cloud Services,"RupeeRedee Achieved 5X Capability by Migrating to AWS Cloud Services Team Rapyder June 19, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> RupeeRedee Achieved 5X Capability by Migrating to AWS Cloud Services About The Client Since its inception in 2018, Gurugram-based fintech start-up RupeeRedee has provided instant small-ticket and flexible digital personal loans to the underserved population. It leverages state-of-the-art technology and data sciences to make lending safe and fast. The start-up’s customers include first-time borrowers who could not secure loans elsewhere, salaried, and self-employed. RupeeRedee has been expanding its operations rapidly and today its services in over 35 cities from just ten cities in 2018. Its services are available 24X7, thus beneficial during emergencies, which could be personal and business-related. The Business Need With the expansion of operations, the number of web and mobile applications increased, and the expected increase in demand and new opportunities required a much more robust technology infrastructure. Additionally, the intricate architecture, with the mixed-use of open-source and enterprise technologies, required a large-scale and robust cloud service that was scalable and secure! The existing service provider had the following challenges: performance issues, downtime issues, best practices being compromised, unable to address the need for redundancy, auto-scaling, and disaster recovery. Being prone to risks was inevitable as they were running on a public server. Moreover, there was a lack of monitoring and other support challenges from Rackspace too! RupeeRedee wanted to migrate its system to AWS for better availability and reliability. Earlier, they were leveraging Vyatta Gateway, where the firewall and VPN were being used by Rackspace, which had to be mapped and replicated from scratch upon migration as AWS did not support Vyatta. They were also looking at external security elements available with AWS to be included to improve overall security. The organization was looking for a partner with AWS expertise to help develop its complete infrastructure, including 40+ cloud servers to AWS cloud. They were also looking at external security elements to be included to improve overall security. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with expertise and experience in successful cloud migration services, was chosen by the client to help migrate to AWS Cloud. The Solution Rapyder’s team of Cloud Architects had several online assessments (due to social distancing and lockdown) and discovery sessions with the client’s infrastructure and DevOps teams to understand the latter’s requirement for migration to AWS Cloud. The team then conceptualized and created a robust and customized solution around AWS services for the migration. The following proposed solution was implemented by Rapyder for a successful migration to AWS while ensuring that the best practices and business continuity principles are also applied. Amazon EC2 was leveraged as it provided resizable compute capacity in the AWS cloud. By offering IaaS, it also provided complete control of computing resources, which could be scaled as per requirement. AWS IAM was used to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Microsoft SQL Servers, their primary database management system, which they were running, was migrated in negligible downtime. Amazon Aurora, which Amazon RDS fully manages, was leveraged. This provides security, reliability, and high availability. Amazon RDS automates time-consuming administrative tasks too. Security was a critical factor being a fintech solution platform. AWS WAF was used to help protect web applications or APIs against attacks that could impact availability and security while consuming excessive resources. Amazon CloudWatch was used to monitor the applications and alerts in case of any changes in resource utilization or unhealthy servers, wherein timely action could be taken. The Benefits This migration to AWS cloud has brought several benefits to RupeeRedee platform. There was a significant improvement in handling a higher number of customer traffic, 500% more! Scalability was established for any future requirements. A significant reduction in costs was observed despite higher volumes of traffic. Savings of up to 30 percent with a few more optimizations is expected with the migration. The new program’s free AWS credits were an additional bonus. The response time on the website and the app is much faster, with fewer downtimes. There has been an overall improvement in user experience too. All earlier manual interventions, such as regular backups, fault tolerance, and mirroring, have been automated with this transition.

case_study,Squarepanda got Significant Reduction in Time-to-Market With AWS Cloud,"Squarepanda got Significant Reduction in Time-to-Market With AWS Cloud Team Rapyder October 5, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Squarepanda got Significant Reduction in Time-to-Market With AWS Cloud About The Client Headquartered in the US, with offices in Mumbai and Beijing, SquarePanda was founded by Andy Butler, the CEO, who initially started this to help his dyslexic daughter to learn. SquarePanda is an award-winning, edtech literacy platform and research-based phonics learning system for pre-readers and early readers worldwide. Equipped with this AI-based platform that assesses and engages learners, SquarePanda aims to empower all children to reach their full potential. Square Panda’s adaptive platform helps children globally, across skill sets and socio-economic backgrounds, to equip themselves with reading, writing, and communicative skills. The learning experience is joyful and based on innovative teaching practices. The Business Need The applications were already hosted on AWS in the US. However, with the new setup in India, SquarePanda wanted to expand its operations in India and China and implement the hosting of applications on AWS in these new geographical locations. The client wanted to address the business need for a faster go-to-market facility and deliver an enhanced customer experience that would be brought about with this implementation. It was looking for a partner who could provide them with an AWS solution for their application and ensure scalability, high availability, and security. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with extensive experience and competency in successful cloud migration and implementation services, was chosen and partnered with. This led to the Customer looking for a solution that would improve its delivery and support of IT while lowering the total cost of ownership. The Solution To effectively address the business need of the Client, Rapyder’s team of Cloud Architects thoroughly studied the former’s requirement for implementation. A customized solution around AWS services was implemented while applying Cloud Deployment Architecture best practices and business continuity principles. Rapyder implemented the following proposed solution and architecture approach: In the new AWS infrastructure, all the servers were launched in private subnets for ease of administration and control, with most components deployed in multi-AZ configuration to avoid single-point failure. AWS-managed load balancer was used to balance the traffic across two availability zones. The balancer was configured to route all site traffic, including dynamic pages. AWS-managed NAT Gateway was used for any outbound traffic from servers in private subnets. Monitoring and alerts were set up on each server to monitor metrics like CPU, memory, and disk. Cloudtrail was enabled for all regions. CI/CD pipelines were set up for each application component, where AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy were used. The Benefits Time-to-market was significantly reduced by 30%, with high agility achieved. The new infrastructure was up and running in two weeks. No single point of failure was witnessed as the environment was running in high availability behind the load balancer.

case_study,Rapyder Empowers Stellaps with a Cutting-Edge Gen-AI Powered Multilingual Chatbot!,"Rapyder Empowers Stellaps with a Cutting-Edge Gen-AI Powered Multilingual Chatbot! Team Rapyder May 7, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Rapyder Empowers Stellaps with a Cutting-Edge Gen-AI Powered Multilingual Chatbot! Introduction: In today’s competitive business landscape, providing exceptional customer service is no longer optional – it’s essential. Stellapps stands out as the first of its kind startup in India, dedicated to the digitization of the dairy supply chain. Founded in 2011, it is an IIT Madras incubated, Bangalore based, Internet of Things (IoT) startup with a primary focus on data acquisition and machine learning. Milk, being the largest crop on this planet, highlights a strong demand for technology interventions, particularly in emerging markets where the yield per animal is low, traceability is inadequate, and quality is not up to the mark. Digitization of the Agri-Dairy supply chain in emerging markets is the area where Stellapps aids in unlocking unprecedented value on a very large scale. Industry: Dairy Offering: Gen AI Business Need: StellApps has an application the caters to farmers from rural India. The application helps farmers to get the detail for the farming related queries. Currently the existing application is not able to handle the native language features and sharing response only in English. As a result of this end-user of the application are not getting the desired benefit from this application. The StellApps team wants to enhance the application by introducing a feature that allows users to record audio questions in their native language. These questions relate to topics such as taking care of cattle, managing/handling the crops etc. In response, the application should provide response in the farmer’s local language with correct and accurate details. Implementation: Rapyder has proposed a solution powered by GenAI capabilities. We proposed solution using AWS Bedrock to answer the query from the existing documents. We are taking RAG based approach using Amazon RDS PostgreSQL as Vector DB and Amazon S3 as raw storage. We are creating a data pipeline by using services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon ECS with Fargate, AWS ECR and Amazon API Gateway to keep the data updated. To build the GenAI based solution for the use case, there are two major activities that we need to address as part of the solution: Build Knowledge base for chatbot using PDF document Build the chat API that understands the user query and provide the accurate response Farmers or villagers, the primary users, can ask questions in their local language by recording their voices. The audio is then translated to English using the Whisper API hosted on ECS Fargate. The translated text is used to search PGVector, extracting relevant information from documents. This information, along with RAG based approach using Bedrock, generates responses in English text. Stellapps own application uses the transcript from our solution to create the output in native farmers source language. Solution Architecture: The core of our GenAI solution is a microservices-based architecture deployed on the AWS cloud. This architecture provides scalability, flexibility, and resilience, ensuring that the chatbot can meet the demands of Stellapps. Component: Knowledge Base pipeline: As per AWS best practices, we have kept raw data in S3 bucket. An AWS Lambda event will be triggered to pre-process the uploaded data. We are performing the embedding using Amazon Bedrock Titan model on the raw data, and ingesting the embeddings into Amazon RDS PGVector DB. GenAI Activity: We have created Whisper ECS API that accepts audio, and performs the transcription, and parse transcription to LLM API. We are converting the English input text into embeddings using Amazon Bedrock Titan model. We have implemented the data retrieval on VectorDB using similarity search algorithm using Langchain based approach. Response is getting created by using Claude2 model with help of Langchain based RAG pipeline using refined prompts after getting input from the StellApps team. As part of best practices, if the context or answer is not available for the given query chatbot is politely asking the end-user to connect with customer care and relevant field expert doctors. LLM based tuning & improvement: Used chunking for the knowledge-based data while embedding data into PGVector. Experimented different “K” values while setting up RAG pipeline to get the better results while performing similarity for the query. Performed parameter tuning for TopP, token length and temperature control for getting the good accuracy. Added prompt engineering best practices and ensured that no false information is being provided as response and input is added to get the information vetted from the doctor or field experts. AWS Services: Amazon S3 Amazon RDS Amazon ECS with Fargate AWS ECR Amazon API Gateway AWS Lambda AWS Bedrock Reaping Rewards: Added feature to handle Indian languages with higher accuracy, this will help to get a larger Indian user-base. Customer is currently serving more than 100K farmers who are set to get benefitted from this solution. Reduced effort and maintenance cost for Knowledge base pipeline. Multi-lingual chatbot helped the business acquire more users and create more penetration across multiple geographical location serving with more than 15 languages across India. Customer is already acquired 17% new customer and growing As for many issue users were earlier visiting veterinary doctor, facing waiting time resulting in unsatisfactory outcome and spending cost for trivial issues. With this solution Customer team received positive feedback and appreciation for the integration and cost saved for the end-user.

Since its inception, Fibe has processed over a million loans and has been pivotal in simplifying access to financial services, making it a beloved tool for mid-income individuals across India. Fibe, hereafter referred to as “Customer”. Industry: Fintech Offering: Gen AI Business Need: Customer was using traditional dialogue driven chatbot to answer the loan related queries. The queries range from simple FAQ to customer specific questions related to payment due dates etc. Because the customer was using dialogue driven approach, lots of questions from end users were restricted to receive answers only for predefined questions. This caused an increase in the number of calls to their call center which in turn increased the operational cost. The customer was looking for a context based free flow chatbot to interact with the end users. Implementation: To address the identified shortcomings and enhance the chatbot’s capabilities, a GenAI-based solution is proposed. This solution will integrate several key features to ensure improved performance and adaptability: Knowledge Base Management: Develop a centralized system to manage FAQ sheets, APIs, and other business documents, streamlining information access and updates. Contextually Relevant Responses: Utilize advanced LLMs to generate tailored responses based on user queries, enhancing accuracy and usefulness. Free-flow Human-like Conversation: Leverage existing data for the chatbot to engage in natural, personalized conversations with users, improving user experience Integrate RAG System: Incorporate a Retrieval Augmentation & Generation system to dynamically retrieve real-time data, enriching chatbot responses with up-to-date information. Handling Dynamic and Static Queries: Equip the chatbot to effectively handle both real-time and static inquiries, ensuring timely and accurate responses to user queries. AWS Deployment Architecture: Implementation Strategies and Enhancements: 1. Chat Pipeline: Platform Evolution: The chatbot journey commenced with Amazon Bedrock Claude 2 and evolved to Amazon Bedrock Claude Instant 2.1 for expedited response times. Contextual Enrichment: Amazon Bedrock Titan was instrumental in embedding the FAQ sheet, augmenting responses with contextual understanding. Data Management and Authentication: Amazon DynamoDB facilitated data storage for session management and contextualization of user queries. The chatbot adeptly managed two distinct user personas: guest users and registered customers, with authentication handled via backend APIs using CustomerID. 2. Data Pipeline: FAQ Management: A robust data pipeline was established to manage FAQs stored on Vector DB deployed on Amazon EKS, ensuring continuous updates without disrupting chatbot functionality. Customer API Integration: Another pipeline was created to interact with Customer APIs, retrieving crucial details such as payment dates and due dates specific to a user. LLM-based Key Work and Improvements: Model Enhancement: The switch from Claude 2.1 to Claude Instant significantly improved response times, enhancing overall user experience. Parameter Tuning and Refinement: Parameter tuning and the addition of XML tags and placeholders within prompts refined response generation, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant answers. Custom Logic Implementation: A bespoke logic was developed to enable agents to discern whether a query should be addressed through FAQ or necessitated a customer API call, resulting in optimized response times. Admin Control Options: Administrators were provided with parameter tuning options through API headers, granting control over parameters such as Top P, token length, and temperature for tailored chatbot responses. This chatbot is designed to answer queries related to fintech and based on the knowledge base vector DB. We have implemented custom guardrails approach to handle situation where end-users were asking irrelevant questions, example: How to make a lemonade?, Who is the Prime Minister of India etc. We have implemented few shot prompting to make the response more appealing to the customer that ensures that response is polite and graceful and does not add statements such as “based on context”, “based on API response” in the final outcome. Implemented Vectorization method while storing the data in VectorDB to ensure smooth and faster data retrieval. We have also enabled ranking and filtering based on similarity threshold values and metadata stored in VectorDB. AWS Services: Amazon S3 Amazon Bedrock Amazon API Gateway AWS Lambda Amazon DynamoDB Amazon EKS Amazon VPC Amazon EC2 Amazon ECR Reaping Rewards: With rapid response generation clocking in at an impressive 2-3 seconds, users experienced minimal wait times, significantly enhancing overall user experience. Fibe chatbot is now handling more than 4 lakh conversation and over 5 Million user base, having ~10 messages on average per conversation. This chatbot has streamlined and automated 95% of the agent based chat for dynamic queries. The enhanced chatbot with its accurate responses for the end users, resulted in 15% reduction in the number of agent conversation made to the agents than before, hence contributing to saving operational cost close to 200K USD. Implementation ensured better maintenance of the knowledge base and an easy-to-update pipeline, further optimizing resource utilization, and reducing operational overheads for the customer.

case_study,Neogrowth Significant Increase in Performance & Cost Savings With AWS,"Neogrowth Significant Increase in Performance & Cost Savings With AWS Team Rapyder March 11, 2024 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Neogrowth Significant Increase in Performance & Cost Savings With AWS The Client Founded in 2012 and an ISO 9001:2015 certified player in the SME digital lending space, NeoGrowth is a Mumbai-based platform with a PAN India presence. Registered with the RBI, the organization’s approach includes innovative technology, a digital payment ecosystem, and flexible payment options. This fintech case study about NeoGrowth’s mission is to have a positive social impact on the ﬁnancial lives of SMEs by leveraging the digital payments ecosystem. With over 1,000 employees across 29 branches along with 2000+ channel partners, and over 17,000 customers, NeoGrowth serves industries such as F & B, hospitality, healthcare and pharma, automobile, and apparel. Digital Lending The MSME sector certainly has high growth potential, but securing funds from banks to fuel its growth has always been challenging. With banks demanding collaterals and imposing several restrictions, SMEs could not run smoothly. However, in the recent past, with technological advancements, several ﬁntech organizations are encouraging new entrepreneurs in the sector by enabling easy access to ﬁnance with digital lending platforms. NeoGrowth is one such platform striving to bridge the credit gap of MSMEs and offers customized products to address multiple business needs of customers. More than before, with Covid 19 pandemic, SMEs are playing a bigger role in the nation’s economic growth, and platforms such as NeoGrowth are also seeing an increase in demand for their services. Business Need As customers increased, efﬁciency, scalability, and continuous delivery became priorities driving NeoGrowth to adopt the scalability of microservices architecture along with container orchestration. This would support its developers to bring their applications from the development to the production stage at record speed and provide scalability and ﬂexibility of their applications. As an existing customer of Rapyder Cloud Solutions for managing its applications on the cloud AWS cloud platform, NeoGrowth, however, was still running microservices on a couple of static servers where-in each task demanded varying amounts of memory and CPU, leading to performance inefﬁciencies. In the absence of accurate resource allocation, the limitation in the memory would negatively impact the entire application, leading to service delays. To address this challenge, NeoGrowth consulted Rapyder’s engineers to move to microservices-based architecture and container orchestration with AWS ECS. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with expertise and experience in successful cloud migration and managed services, completed the transition and deployment of container orchestration. The Solution Covid-19 has undoubtedly accelerated cloud adoption by several years. Companies are increasingly leveraging container technology to fast-track application development, deployment, and portability of apps across different platform infrastructures. Rapyder’s expert team of Cloud Architects conceptualized and stitched a powerful and customized solution around Amazon Web Services for the task. Rapyder’s team supported the smooth transition to the successful deployment of microservices-based architecture and AWS ECS enablement. The team ﬁrst made the shift to containerize the microservices architecture at NeoGrowth. Unlike the traditional static server deployment, with the application’s components and functions in a single instance, microservices architecture splits the application into multiple services that perform different functions, each with a different logical function. These microservices were then placed in containers. Container orchestration leverages tools and platforms to automate, manage and schedule workloads that are deﬁned by individual containers. Containerization of the application was then done, followed by container orchestration with the Amazon ECS platform to manage the entire life cycle. This container orchestration is supported in automating the scheduling, deployment, scaling, and overall management of containers across a ﬂeet of servers. Amazon ECS, being highly scalable with high performance, allowed developers to run effortlessly, scale containerized applications, and automatically reschedule containers if required. Rapyder’s team also supported the client in leveraging spot instances with AWS services, in an economically priced model with steep discount offers, for test and development. The Benefits Building and delivering software reliably are key to an organization’s success and positive business outcomes in a digital economy. Equally important is the visibility across and within the software coding and delivery processes to ensure high speed and scalability with demand. The transition to microservices-based architecture did not impact the running of the business. Developers could now work faster due to smaller code bases in microservices with lesser complexities and dependencies of functions, bringing about better operational efﬁciency. Code reviews and updates were done faster, and failures could be isolated without bringing the entire system. Moreover, developers could leverage different programming languages effortlessly. All these led to continuous delivery, thereby establishing higher productivity. Scalability was independent of each microservice where only the required component of an app could be This ensured optimization of resources making the whole process cost-efﬁcient. Leveraging spot instances that came with AWS economically priced model also helped in cost- optimization to a large Above all, the ease of use of Amazon ECS in itself was beneﬁcial.

case_study,Limechat Migrated Its Applications from AZURE to AWS,"Limechat Migrated Its Applications from AZURE to AWS Team Rapyder April 1, 2022 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Limechat Migrated Its Applications from AZURE to AWS Introduction: LimeChat is India’s first level-3 AI chatbot company. LimeChat’s focus on e-commerce internet-first brands increases online sales and conversions and reduces customer support costs by 50%. LimeChat’s smart chatbot offers customers personalized and contextual conversational experiences wherever they are in the buyer’s journey. With integrations across CRM software, store management platform, payments network, and logistics platforms, LimeChat take great care of customer interactions for its clients. Business Need: The Limechat hosted a helpdesk solution for customer support and Chatbot logic on Kubernetes Cluster on the Microsoft Azure Platform. However, it faced challenges in ongoing support while running on Azure and wanted to migrate the application to AWS Cloud for better Support and Manageability. Below were the requirements from Limechat A Separate isolated and secure environment is to be created on the AWS cloud. Earlier, Limechat hosted their Application on Kubernetes at Azure and wanted to use the same Kubernetes platform on AWS. Limechat wanted to have secure, reliable, and scalable Infrastructure at AWS. At Azure, Limechat was using Instances with small configurations for PostgreSQL and Redis as they had separate PostgreSQL and Redis Databases for every end customer. At AWS, it needed a single PostgreSQL and Redis Database with a powerful configuration. It was looking forward to seamless migration with no data loss and with very minimal downtime. Limechat wanted to use AWS-managed services wherever possible. Implementation To address the objectives defined Business Need section, Rapyder worked with Limechat and came up with AWS Cloud Deployment Architecture for implementation. As Limechat was using Kubernetes on Azure, it recommended using AWS Managed Orchestration Service – Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). We applied the AWS best practices and business continuity principles and followed through the implementation as explained below: Considering end-customer demographic locations, AWS Mumbai Region was selected. A separate network with a combination of VPC/ Subnets was created as per AWS best practices. All the servers and Databases were hosted in a private subnet, thus eliminating direct access to the application, resulting in additional application security. AWS Managed Kubernetes Service – AWS EKS was used to host containerized microservice-based Applications. Scalability is considered at both levels, i.e., at the Worker node level (auto-scaling group) and POD level. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL is implemented in MultiAZ for High availability. For Data Security, encryption is considered. In Transit: using Lets Encrypt SSL At Rest: EBS and S3 Data encryption using AWS KMS AWS managed Service – Elasticache for Redis was implemented as an in-memory Database. AWS Services: AWS Managed Kubernetes Service – Amazon EKS, Application Load Balancer (ALB), NAT Gateway, Amazon RDS PostgreSQL, Amazon Elasticache for Redis, Amazon Cloudwatch, Amazon SNS, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon S3, IAM, AWS Config, AWS KMS. Third-Party Solution None Reaping Rewards: With this solution, we provided a Secure, Reliable, and Scalable Infrastructure on AWS EKS, offering High Availability. With the Rapyder team’s assistance, Limechat could Migrate to AWS Cloud with minimal downtime and zero data loss. Enterprise-grade RDS PostgreSQL in MultiAZ provides the expected performance. AWS managed Elasticache for Redis in high availability and boosted customer application performance by providing sub-millisecond response time. Using AWS Managed Services like RDS and Elasticache for Redis also released Infrastructure Management overhead from Limechat’s shoulders.

case_study,Biryani by Kilo’s Achieved Incredible ROI & Customer Experience Migration To AWS Cloud,"Biryani by Kilo’s Achieved Incredible ROI & Customer Experience Migration To AWS Cloud Team Rapyder March 21, 2022 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Biryani by Kilo’s Achieved Incredible ROI & Customer Experience Migration To AWS Cloud About the client Gurugram-based food-tech start-up, Biryani by Kilo (BBK), launched in 2015, has today expanded its reach across 30 cities in India with around 70 outlets and continues to grow exponentially. It offers Biryani to the masses and uses the best ingredients, including expensive branded rice, spices handpicked from Kerala, and stringently selected meats and vegetables for its Biryani and Kebabs. This cloud-kitchen start-up aims to grow to 200 plus outlets across India in the next two years and expand to international destinations, with an estimated Rs. 500 crore annual revenue by then. Client’s challenge and the business need BBK’s fast growth is driven by its increasing number of customers and expanding footprint. Although the organization had migrated to AWS Cloud from running on a Private Cloud, it faced several operations and customer service challenges. In addition, due to the inaccurate configuration of the AWS Cloud architecture, BBK’s business-critical infrastructure was impacted. Customers’ orders from food aggregators such as Zomato and Swiggy were getting missed at the outlets due to intermittent server outages, thereby losing crucial business and spoiling the customer’s experience. This challenge worsened when there was a significant spike in order volume during weekends, holidays, and special days, such as Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve. Database optimization was another area that had to be addressed. Cloud Security was another area that needed to be addressed, as the organization was using payment gateways for food orders. High availability and scaling of cloud infrastructure were required, without which the business functions could suffer. The client was unhappy with their AWS partner and was looking for a more experienced partner who could help them derive the proper benefits of AWS and help solve their issues. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with expertise and experience in successful cloud migration services, proposed a new solution to address all the above challenges. Rapyder’s team of Cloud Architects had several discovery sessions with the client to understand the latter’s requirement for implementing AWS Cloud. Then, they conceptualized and stitched a powerful, robust, and customized solution around AWS services for the task. Rapyder implemented the following proposed solution for a successful implementation of AWS Cloud. Rapyder re-configured the cloud architecture and ensured successful migration to the re-architected AWS cloud environment to suit the growing requirements of the organization. Being content heavy with videos and pictures of the dishes, these files were stored and continuously running across the network. They could be accessed by mobile phones even in Tier 2 cities from a 2G network too. AWS CloudFront was leveraged to deliver content continuously across all networks and geographies. Downtime challenges was addressed to contain business and customer losses, with all orders to the organization across touchpoints getting executed. Overall security of the infrastructure, covering payment gateways and all other security parameters, such as information and data security, was achieved. CloudWatch was leveraged to monitor the infrastructure, and proactive measures were taken to address issues. Database optimization was established with all DB layer parameters put in place. Availability and Scalability aspects were established in this new-architected infrastructure. All Applications and Databases were migrated to AWS cloud during non-peak hours with minimum downtime not affecting business operations. The entire solution that was stitched and implemented met the criteria of Security best practices. Business benefits With the significant reduction in downtime, the high volume of food orders placed was attended to and served, increasing business and ROI. Content delivery through videos was achieved, leading to smooth business transactions across all outlets in Tier I and Tier 2 cities and from 2G, 3G, or 4G networks, thereby enhancing customer experience. Cloud Infrastructure performance improved as a highly available and scalable architecture was provided at all the layers with the deployment. Employing AWS services such as self-managed EC2 instances and leveraging auto-scaling observed significant cost savings. Ease of management of applications and optimal performance was achieved with the migration. The migration of applications and databases was completed with negligible downtime with no impact on the business. Currently, the Cloud Infrastructure is maintained 24X7 by Rapyder, with BBK also signing up for the Managed Services. QUOTE: This biryani startup case study appreciating the effort Rapyder team, Kaushik Roy, Head of BBK, said, “The Rapyder team of Cloud experts was able to zero down on the several issues present in the old Cloud Architecture to create a stable and secure environment. Now, we can provide a better customer experience, where orders are not missed with a faster turn-around time of service delivery being achieved as well.” He added, “We have also signed up for Rapyder’s ongoing Managed Services to monitor and manage the Cloud Infrastructure.” Case Studies Download Case Studies Share Search Case Studies Recent Case Studies NIMF Achieves 50% Cost Savings with Saasification of Their Desktop Application January 17, 2025 Rapyder Enabled 100x Engineers to Successfully Implement Automation on AWS Cloud with a Modern Infrastructure Approach December 16, 2024 Rapyder’s Chatbot Resolves 95% of Queries with Ease and Precision November 18, 2024 Categories Migration Pinpoint Modernization Managed Services Gen-AI End-User Computing DevOps Database Migration Data Analytics/Machine Learning All Categories Articles Blogs Case Studies Cloud Optimization Cloud Security Cost Optimization Resources Data Analytics/Machine Learning Database Migration DevOps End-User Computing Events Gen-AI Managed Services Migration Modernization Pinpoint Tags All Tags AWS Ecommerce/Retail EdTech Financial Services FinTech Healthcare IoT IT/ITES Manufacturing Media & Entertainment Travel/Visa Firm Subscribe to the latest insights Subscribe to the latest insights Email Submit PrevPrevious NextNext Related Case Studies NIMF Achieves 50% Cost Savings with Saasification of Their Desktop Application Read More Rapyder Enabled 100x Engineers to Successfully Implement Automation on AWS Cloud with a Modern Infrastructure Approach Read More Rapyder’s Chatbot Resolves 95% of Queries with Ease and Precision Read More By Team Rapyder Get in Touch!

Virginia to European Region About Client: Trilasoft, Founded in 2007, Trilasoft works passionately to bring ideas to life and create applications for start-ups and enterprises. The company offers its customers a unique value proposition to meet their transformation and innovation challenges. Trilasoft supports its customers through the entire development lifecycle, from conceptualization and designing to implementation and ongoing maintenance, to ensure products and services meet the requirements of tomorrow. Customer Business Need: The customer is expanding its operations in European Region, and to operate in that region, it had to comply with regional GDPR rules. Hence they would like to migrate their Application & Infrastructure from the AWS N—Virginia region to AWS European Region. Below were the requirements from the customer: A separate isolated and secure environment in the European AWS region to develop applications for their end customers. Ensure no data is lost during migration from one region to another, and their integrity & accuracy should be maintained. The entire migration activity should complete within the least possible downtime. A highly reliable and durable solution to store their data & keep it safe from theft or loss. Make use of AWS-managed services for database and filesystem services. A centralized identity management system is in place to track & manage access smoothly. Solution: Our AWS Certified Solutions Architects conducted detailed workshop sessions with the customer to understand their existing setup, challenges, and migration requirements. In the discovery, we also captured information about the data size to be migrated and affordable downtime. Following the solution, an approach was proposed and implemented with best practices, and then migrate their production workload to AWS; A separate network with a combination of VPC/Subnets was created as per the best practices. All the servers and databases will be in a private subnet to match their current architecture. The “Backup & Restore method” was adapted to migrate EC2 instances and RDS instances from N—Virginia Region to the Stockholm region. DataSync was used to transfer data from one region to another. AWS WAF was set up to protect AWS resources from SQL injection, cross-scripting, and DDoS attacks. Application auto-scaling is configured to scale our EC2 instances as needed during sudden growth in the user request. A read replica of RDS was set up to improve read performance from the database. AWS Services: AWS WAF, ALB, NAT, EC2, RDS, EFS, S3, CloudTrail, Glue, Accelerator, Lambda, CloudWatch, SNS Third-Party Solution: No Business Benefits: Since all data and workloads are moved to the European region, the customer could operate its business for European clients following GDPR rules. AWS WAF firewall provided an advanced level of data protection. By configuring RDS replicas, application read response time greatly improved. Configuration of application auto-scaling enabled provisioning of new instances as the user request/load increased, improving application performance. Data stored is maintained, and automated backups are ensured by performing regular data backup/restore drills.

case_study,"Bewakoof.com Migrates to AWS Cloud, Achieved Performance & Cost Reduction of 30%","Bewakoof.com Migrates to AWS Cloud, Achieved Performance & Cost Reduction of 30% Team Rapyder March 12, 2021 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Bewakoof.com Migrates to AWS Cloud, Achieved Performance & Cost Reduction of 30% About The Client Bewakoof.com is a direct-to-consumer online apparel company with a fast-growing and robust customer base since its inception in 2012. It has grown to become a successful business and lifestyle brand with an annual turnover of Rs. 210 crores in FY 2019-20. The company believes in improving the customer experience, product design, and supply chain processes through technological innovation. With a current employee strength of over 250, Bewakoof has sold more than one crore of products. Its app has over 60 lakh downloads and continues to grow by the hour. Bewakoof aims to become a household brand, cross Rs.1,000 in revenues by 2024, and leverage technology to drive the scale. The Business Need Bewakoof.com was earlier running its workloads in GCP, which was deployed and managed by its internal team. However, with Bewakoof’s focus on business growth and scale, its management moved the workloads and entire operations to AWS cloud, given the latter’s reliability, the numerous managed services, and the efﬁcient cost structure offerings. It wanted to leverage the AWS cloud suite to power its platform backend, marketing tech, and data services. Bewakoof was exploring a suitable and reliable partner to support them in migrating and deploying the workloads seamlessly onto AWS, with minimal downtime. The Client also wanted to ensure that best practices were being followed along with associated cost beneﬁts and no data loss. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with expertise and experience in successful cloud migration services, was chosen by the Client to help move the workloads to AWS Cloud. The Solution Rapyder’s team of Cloud Architects had several discovery sessions with the Client to understand the latter’s requirement for migration to AWS Cloud. The team then conceptualized and stitched a robust and customized solution around AWS services for the migration. The following proposed solution was implemented by Rapyder for a successful migration to AWS while ensuring that best practices and business continuity principles were also applied: EKS cluster in AWS was conﬁgured to setup the application on AWS. The CICD pipeline was built using native AWS services to ensure business continuity, faster go-to-market, and integration with other AWS services. The migration activity was completed within the agreed time frame with the Client. Automated threat detection was implemented using AWS GuardDuty, an ML-based threat detection service that helps identify malicious activities and unauthorized behavior to protect AWS accounts, workload, and data. The Benefits The pandemic and other factors that contributed to the ﬂuctuation of the market also impacted the operational and storage needs of the IT infrastructure in general. By applying business continuity principles and best practices in moving the workloads to AWS Cloud, the Rapyder team brought about a signiﬁcant increase in performance and cost efﬁciency, The cloud cost was reduced by 30 percent, and in the long term, the migration is likely to bring down the cost by a signiﬁcant 15-20 The operational overheads were reduced signiﬁcantly by leveraging the managed services of AWS, such as ElastiCache. Enabled to scale quickly to handle the unexpected spikes in trafﬁc, as and when the need arises. Cost efﬁciency was also achieved by using AMD-based instances on AWS. Application release management was made seamless with building the CICD process for the application running on EKS, thereby ensuring business. The process that was built using native AWS tools ensured better integrations with other AWS services. The migration will drive the platform’s growth by adding more capabilities and SKUs, leading to an increase in the number of monthly visitors. It will help the brand to go regional by enabling the designing of products that align with the cultural and regional ethos besides the region-speciﬁc weather conditions. This will require data streaming, analysis, and quick decision-making that are enabled with the AWS cloud. By leveraging AWS-managed services and deep tech support, Bewakoof can provide an enhanced user experience and customization at scale.

case_study,"NMIMS Cuts Costs by 28%, Up in Performance By Migrate from Azure To AWS","NMIMS Cuts Costs by 28%, Up in Performance By Migrate from Azure To AWS Team Rapyder March 9, 2021 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> NMIMS Cuts Costs by 28%, Up in Performance By Migrate from Azure To AWS About The Client Established in 1981, Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS) is a deemed-to-be University of global repute and a leading name for Management education in India. It is striving to become a globally admired university by 2030. NMIMS prides itself on consistently maintaining high-quality academic and research work with top national and global faculty members. Today, it has grown to 107 schools and 16 disciplines. At the highest level, national bodies, such as NAAC and NBA, accredit this multidisciplinary and multi-campus (across cities) institution. AACSB accredits its management institution, and AMBA accredits its Bengaluru and Hyderabad programs. The NMIMS academic infrastructure is at par with the best in the world today. The Business Need NMIMS was running its Learning Management System (LMS) workload on Microsoft Azure. It was run on a single server with challenges related to application performance besides incurring very high costs. LMS, being crucial in course creation and managing administration, tracking, reporting, and delivery of courses, its performance and cost-effectiveness were top priorities for the institution. The client was exploring a more suitable cloud computing service provider to address the existing challenges and signed up with a partner who could support the migration process. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with expertise and experience in successful cloud migration services, was chosen by the client for migration and implementation. The Solution Rapyder’s expert team of Cloud Architects had several discovery sessions with the client and did a complete analysis to understand the latter’s requirement for the migration. This was followed by Rapyder’s team conceptualizing and stitching a powerful and customized solution around AWS services for the task. The team helped migrate the client’s application from Azure to AWS, tested them on the new location, and consolidated all the web applications on AWS. The robust solution configured and implemented by Rapyder’s team for a successful migration to AWS is captured below: Having understood the need for future scaling on the cloud infrastructure, the Web and DB layers were split to facilitate scaling at a later stage and avoid any single-point failure. Application Load Balancers supporting content-based routing and applications running in containers were placed in front of the web layer as the first line of defense. It also provides additional visibility into the health of the target instances and containers and takes care of bad requests coming from the users. Custom metrics were configured on each server to track the utilization of all the infrastructure metrics. Amazon GuardDuty, the threat detection service, was implemented to intelligently monitor for malicious activities of the AWS account at the network level. Finally, a dry run was performed to ensure the application migration was successful. The Benefits The entire migration from Azure cloud to AWS cloud was done within 2 weeks, with the business up and running soon. This migration of the workload resulted in better response times for the application. The cost was 28% lower with AWS compared to the previous platform’s running cost.

The workspaces were integrated with a self-managed Active Directory hosted on AWS EC2 for authentication with an AD connector. Workspaces were also hardened according to the requirement of the customer. Office & Anti-Virus packages were provided by the customer & included in the image to launch Workspaces. Installation packages for other agent-based software required were also included in the image. All traffic from the Internet has been routed through the site-to-site VPN tunnel to access the Internet and applications. Restricted policies were applied to prevent any data movement between AWS Workspaces & User-machine. Both web-based and client-based applications were configured as part of this setup. AWS Cloudtrail will be configured for tracking the API Calls. AWS Cloudwatch was configured for monitoring various matrices of the setup. AWS Services: AWS Workspaces, Directory Service, NAT Gateway, VPN, Config, S3, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, IAM Third-Party Solution: None Business Benefits: AWS workspaces solve customers’ need for business continuity for all users. With this solution, we were able to provide a secure and reliable remote workplace option for the user set separate from the existing setup. AWS VPN connectivity between AWS & On-Prem data center helped AWS workspaces communicate with applications & data residing on-prem with low latency. Data copy restrictions were applied from AWS Workspaces to users’ machines to safeguard data from theft & loss. AD setup enabled the customer to have standard identity management for their users in AWS Workspaces.

Their vision is to equip students and teachers to achieve their goals through personalized content curation & AI. The Challenge The client has an e-learning platform through which it wants to impart teaching through technology. Their vision is to equip students and teachers to achieve their goals through personalized content curation & AI. The customer had deployed their application on AWS Cloud. They wanted a thorough audit to be done on their deployment on AWS for their learning application. The customer was also looking for a transcoding requirement to integrate with their application so that different formats can be viewed on the platform depending on the user’s choice. The transcoding was being done manually until then. The Solution Rapyder collaborated with the Customer to understand the application and deployment architecture before the audit. As part of the audit, the following things were done: All the security best practices were scanned and reported to the customer on what could be changed. All the security groups were audited, and appropriate changes were suggested and implemented. The AWS Code Deploy would pick the build from AWS S3 and deploy it into the auto-scaling groups of the Test environment. Cloudwatch metrics that were missing as part of the monitoring were implemented, and alarms and dashboards were created for all the resources. The instance type changes were suggested depending on the utilization of the servers for 3 months. Lambda function was created to transcode the videos into the required formats and inform the application about the status. SNS was configured on the S3 bucket to trigger the lambda function. Unused instances were recommended to be terminated. The Benefits The customer was pleased with the audit’s recommendations, and the recommendations were implemented. They integrated the transcoding solution into the application, which reduced the manual transcoding that was done before. It gave cost benefits and a secure infrastructure.

case_study,Tix Technologies Migrates to AWS Cloud with Rapyder,"Tix Technologies Migrates to AWS Cloud with Rapyder Team Rapyder December 15, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Tix Technologies Migrates to AWS Cloud with Rapyder About The Client TIX was founded in 2009 with the single goal of making live events more affordable in Australia. They achieved this by launching Lasttix – a destination for discount ticket offers to theatres, concerts, musicals, and more. Fast forward 10 years, and they have expanded their goal also to make live entertainment more accessible and have done this by launching the TIX app, which, in one straightforward interface, helps its users instantly identify the best ticket prices no matter where they are or what their budget is. TIX now operates in 4 countries with over 1.6 million members. The Business Need CUSTOMER had developed a .NET application for a ticket-selling product, built using Windows Stack, and wanted to host this application on the Cloud. After discussions with the Rapyder team of Cloud engineers, they decided to go with AWS to benefit from the flexibility of Infrastructure sizing and to have a Scalable infrastructure along with High Availability for their different components, as they were expecting massive traffic on the platform. They also wanted to have CI/CD pipelines for each of their application components. The Solution To address the business objectives that needed to be achieved, Rapyder implemented a solution on AWS that, considering the future growth expected, provided Tix Technologies with a flexible and scalable environment: The application has UI, API, and DB layers. All the servers were launched in a private subnet to prevent the servers from being exposed to the public directly. High availability was factored in, and servers were launched in HA mode across different availability zones. UI and API layers were deployed in Auto-scaling groups behind the Application Load Balancer to meet the scaling demand of the Customer. MSSQL enterprise edition was used as DB to run the database in Always-On mode so that high availability would be taken care of. AWS-managed Microsoft AD was implemented, and all the servers made part of the AD to manage authentication centrally. Servers using IAM roles to access the services like S3 and Cloudwatch. IAM users created and only required access provided by using IAM policies. Custom metrics were set up on all servers, and monitoring was enabled by using Cloudwatch. Cloudwatch alarms were also created for CPU, Memory, and Disk Utilization. Antivirus was installed on each server to protect the servers from malware attacks. AWS CloudFormation is used for spinning up the entire infrastructure. CI/CD pipelines have been set up for each application component. AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy were used for CI and CD. Jenkins hosted on EC2 machine. AWS Guard Duty was enabled, and a custom solution was developed using lambda scripts to take action on the findings. Custom Lambda function was also written to notify the Customer of CI/CD. CloudTrail was enabled for all regions. AWS Services EC2, Auto Scaling, Load Balancer, S3, AWS AD, Guard Duty, Code Pipeline, Code Deploy, Lambda, SNS, Work Mail, Systems Manager Third-Party Services Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise 14.0.3023.8 MSSQL Enterprise edition was used for Database in Always-On mode. This enabled the data to be synchronized between two nodes at any time. The application connects to the Database using the Listener, which takes care of the primary and secondary nodes. All the reads will go to a secondary node to distribute the traffic across two nodes. Backups and custom monitoring scripts have also been set up on the databases to monitor the database. Trend Micro Deep Security Trend Micro Deep Security has been used for each server to save the servers from malicious attacks. The agent has been installed on each server, and the new auto-scaling server which will come up will activate the agent using the command in user data. The Benefits Tix Technologies is now successfully running its workloads on AWS Cloud, which can handle the massive traffic with the help of Auto-Scaling groups. All their deployments are automated, and there is no human intervention the same which has reduced their go-to-market. The servers are near auto-healable as the environment is configured to be running in high availability (behind the load balancer and in Auto Scaling groups). Thus, there is no downtime for the applications. Next Case Study: Easypolicy migrates to AWS with Rapyder Cloud Solutions Keep up to date with the latest Case Studies and Stories from Rapyder.

This solution was deployed on AWS LightSail using single-tenant architecture. The deployment was done on separate servers for each client they were supporting. They were looking to make this existing solution more scalable with High-availability multi-tenant architecture to support all their clients with the same single infrastructure. The solution was also highly scalable, along with provisioning for content delivery and server caching with the ability to program code to deploy on the server on every commit they maintained in Code Commit. The Solution The Cloud Consultants of Rapyder conducted a detailed study of the customer’s application. They designed the right solution and configuration that could support the seamless functioning of the application to overcome the challenges mentioned above. The consultants of Rapyder proposed the following solution to achieve the desired results: Amazon EC2 server was provisioned, and all the requirements were carried out. Route53 was used for DNS pointing. RDS was created on a private subnet and restored with SQL dump. Servers were behind ELB and in the auto-scaling Group for high availability and scalability. Auto-scaling launch configuration was created and deployed with a script to fetch code on every new server launch. Lambda code was written to copy the code from AWS code commit repository to the server whenever on every commit. For high security, the Lambda function was created within the same network. AWS Redis is used for providing a central server cache so as not to lose the session cache. AWS CloudFront was implemented for content delivery and restricted bucket only to CDN for better security. The Benefits Deployment of code was automated, reducing the time to market. Auto-scaling reduced the time and manpower required for managing the server monitoring task. The client was able to commit many changes to the code at any time. Security was enhanced by restricting access only through CloudFront. SSL certificate was applied on the load balancer.

case_study,Neogrowth’s ROI of 30% With a Fully Automated CI/CD Solution,"Neogrowth’s ROI of 30% With a Fully Automated CI/CD Solution Team Rapyder November 29, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Neogrowth’s ROI of 30% With a Fully Automated CI/CD Solution About The Client Neogrowth is a pioneer in lending based on the underwriting of digital payment data. It is a NBFC registered with RBI organization and started commercial operations in 2013. The company’s proprietary technology platform offers unsecured loans to merchants who accept customers’ cards and other digital payments. By far, Neogrowth has partnered with 13000+ business merchants to help them grow their businesses. Their mission is to have a positive social impact on the financial lives of small & medium business merchants across India. More than 50% of these merchants are creditworthy but have been excluded from accessing loans based on traditional underwriting methods. The Business Need As an organization that provides loans to SMEs, maintaining a proper customer relation and interaction base is a huge requirement. Hence, the client was developing an internal CRM application for which they performed manual deployments in their environment. This made the development process highly prone to human error, reduced efficiency, and affected the code quality. Developers at Neogrowth were logging into the production servers, which was a major security risk for the organization. With these pain points: Overall development time increased with backlogs of non-critical errors. The process did not allow optimal utilization of resources. Coding process was prone to human error, and rectifying changes was causing unintended consequences. The Solution The client was using GitHub as their version control system for which AWS Code Pipelines were implemented for each environment that would get triggered whenever any commit was made to the corresponding branch of the GitHub repository. As soon as the code was committed, Code Pipeline would get triggered, pulling the code from the repository and triggering the Jenkins build. Jenkins was used to validate the config variables. Hence, in any scenario of any variable missing, the entire build would fail. For any deployment failures, Code Deploy Rollbacks were implemented to deploy the previously stable running version of the application. Upon successful build, AWS Code Deploy would get triggered and Deploy the artifacts to the target servers. The Benefits Cloud experts at Rapyder provided the whole solution in just two weeks, in which the right solution and configuration that could support the seamless functioning of the application were designed to achieve the desired results. Benefits that Neogrowth witnessed were: With a fully automated CI/CD solution, any scope of human-prone errors was removed, which increased the development cycle. With automation in the development cycle, the time to market this CRM application was reduced to 40%. The client witnessed an ROI of 30%. As the development lifecycle was automated, developers now spend more time on development than operations.

case_study,Frrole Migrates From Azure to AWS With Rapyder Cloud Solutions,"Frrole Migrates From Azure to AWS With Rapyder Cloud Solutions Team Rapyder November 29, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Frrole Migrates From Azure to AWS With Rapyder Cloud Solutions About The Client Frrole is a best-in-class AI platform based in Bangalore that works at the intersection of social data and consumer intelligence. They believe that the software must become more intelligent to continue delighting the customer. Frrole has mastered the social data set that can be best utilized to understand consumers at scale and to build the Google of the social web, unleashing the power of accurate and predictive consumer insight for all the software in the world, making it truly intelligent. The Business Need The client uses social media data to build the Google social web. They were already using Azure cloud services for its two flagship products, Scout and Deeper Sense. However, they wanted to migrate to AWS for two major reasons: Reduce the overall cost, Apply best practices to help scale. Thus, Frrole sought an AWS expert to help them successfully migrate. Since both applications were business-critical, the client wanted minimal downtime during the migration. Also, the amount of data to be migrated was in terabytes, and the entire migration had to be done within extremely short timelines. The Solution After studying the working of the applications, cloud experts at Rapyder came up with an optimum solution for migrating the application from Azure to AWS. Our cloud experts stitched a solution with AWS services, and the following solutions were implemented: A VPN connection from AWS to Azure account was provisioned for seamless connectivity. The NoSQL database was extended into AWS, considering the vast amount of data to be transferred. The search engine of the application had terabytes of data in the clusters of AWS by extending the clusters into AWS, which ensured zero downtime. All other servers were created in a private subnet only to be accessed within a VPC for security with a load balancer. The NoSQL database and search engine cluster were deployed across availability zones for HA. Open VPN server was provisioned to connect directly to the instances in private servers locally. NAT gateway was used for all outgoing internet connections from private servers. Reserved instances recommendations helped in reducing the cost further after. The Benefits Considering the timeline requested by the client, the entire migration, including the database of 5 TB, was completed within 10 days. After migrating the entire application to AWS, the client recognized a cost saving of almost 25% compared to the expenses paid on Azure. The solution provided is highly available and scalable at all application layers.

case_study,Rapyder Migrates a Ride-Sharing Startup from GCP to AWS,"Rapyder Migrates a Ride-Sharing Startup from GCP to AWS Team Rapyder November 25, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Rapyder Migrates a Ride-Sharing Startup from GCP to AWS The Challenge The Customer was running multiple workloads on the Google Cloud Platform and had planned to migrate their entire B2C application from GCP to AWS. These were Java-based applications to cater to their customer-facing mobile app APIs with Backend Database as MySQL. This migration was expected to be done with very minimal downtime of maximum 30 minutes. The Solution Consultants at Rapyder had detailed discussions with the Client to understand their requirements and studied the working of their application portfolio to provide an optimum solution for the migration. To address the objectives defined in the statement of work, our Solution Architects stitched the solution around AWS services. The following solution was implemented: AWS Mumbai region was considered for the hosting of applications. All the servers behind the application load balancers were provisioned in private subnets in different AZ, which was behind the load balancer. Load balancer would offload the SSL certificate and send traffic to the appropriate instance. Public-facing servers were launched in a public subnet based on the requirement. OpenVPN server was provisioned to connect directly to the instances in private servers from local. RDS MySQL with Read replica was configured for Database. AWS ACM used for SSL certificates to be applied on the load balancer. ElasticSearch was provisioned to be used as managed service and was replicated to AWS by backup and restore. RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ were configured on EC2. NAT Gateway was used for all outgoing internet connections from private servers. AWS CloudTrail is enabled to monitor activity on the AWS account. AWS CloudWatch setup is done by monitoring the servers. Route53 will be used as DNS Service for weighted routing between GCP and AWS before routing 100% of traffic to AWS. Database Migration was used for migration as the Customer had a very slim window for the cut-over to production. The Outcome Highly available and very scalable architecture has been provisioned at all layers. The Client is expecting huge growth in its customer base year-on-year, and with the infrastructure provisioned by Rapdyer, they are now well-prepared to meet the challenges of the near future.

To make the international travel plan of its customers smooth and seamless, the client operates a website that educates people about the important visa requirements of all the countries across the globe and helps them throughout the entire visa application process. The Challenge The increasing popularity of the client’s online visa assistance service expanded its customer base at an astonishing rate. But the client could not respond and scale in pace with the growing demand for its services. The client had three departments (Development, Quality Assurance, and Production) working separately to manage its website, and this was not only delaying the software releases but also affecting the ability of the client to deliver its services at high velocity. The client approached Rapyder to modernize its traditional software development and infrastructure process to accelerate its software release frequency, upgrade its website faster than its competitors, and deliver its visa assistance services more agilely to serve its growing customer base better. The Solution Rapyder advised its client to introduce Enterprise DevOps in the organization to modernize the client’s traditional software development process. Rapyder advised its client to implement DevOps Automation along with Enterprise DevOps to modernize the client’s existing IT infrastructure. Rapyder also offered its Cloud DevOps service to help the client test the developed code, deploy the test infrastructure, run the end-to-end test, and then use the codes faster with just a few clicks of the mouse. The Benefits The client could rapidly release new software updates, features, and fixes. The testing and deployment time was reduced by 90%. This helped the client better serve its growing customer base and remain competitive in the market. The efficiency and productivity of the client’s Development, Quality Assurance, and Operations teams increased greatly. Now they have more time to focus on improving the features and quality of their company’s services. Modernizing IT Infrastructure and the ‘Pay As You Go’ Model of Rapyder DevOps as a Service helped the client save a lot of money. Now the client can spend more to improve its visa services and increase its customer reach.

The data center infrastructure was up for renewal, and the Customer wanted more flexibility in managing their infrastructure and was exploring AWS. The management of HotelHub was also looking for a platform on which they could innovate their business solutions faster. The Solution Our AWS-certified Solutions Architects conducted multiple rounds of discussions with HotelHub and developed a proposal that would best fulfill the Customer’s requirements. Best practices and business continuity principles were applied to the solution, and the following considerations/ Architecture Approach was taken: AWS Ireland was chosen as the region for hosting, keeping in mind their customer base. All the servers were created in private subnets in different AZs behind the load balancer. Web Servers would connect to API servers via Network Load Balancer, also provisioned in the private subnet. Both Web and API layers were highly available, with multiple servers running behind the load balancer. Static servers were used at both the App and UI layers, considering the predictive nature of traffic on the application. MySQL was set up on EC2 instances across AZs for High Availability. Custom automation was written for the auto-failover of MySQL instances. The MS SQL standard was also run on EC2 in mirroring mode across AZ for high availability. Failover of the DB was also automated and tested by leveraging Route53 private hosted zone with Lambda, which was configured to update the DNS in case of failover. Microsoft Active Directory was hosted in two AZs for high availability and synced with on-premises AD. Site-to-site VPN connection with on-premises to send the logs to Splunk for log analysis. Native backups were set up on the database setups and configured to go to AWS S3. AWS Services EC2, Lambda, CloudWatch, Guard Duty, AWS Config, S3 Third-Party Services SQL Server, Ncache, Symantec Antivirus, Splunk The Benefits Today, the migrated workloads are running successfully on AWS without any downtimes.

case_study,Extramarks Achieves 15% ROI by Leveraging AWS Auto Scaling,"Extramarks Achieves 15% ROI by Leveraging AWS Auto Scaling Team Rapyder October 7, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Extramarks Achieves 15% ROI by Leveraging AWS Auto Scaling About The Client Extramarks aims to transform the conventional education system by providing modern-day total learning digital solutions to students and teachers. With easy-to-understand, engaging content empowered by advanced technology, Extramarks effectively creates a bright, personalized, and interactive learning environment in the classroom and at home. With features like- Progress Tracker, Mentor Support, Study Scheduler, Group Work, and many more, this one-app-one solution is currently used by over 9000 schools across India, Singapore, Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, and South Africa. The Business Need ‘Extramarks’ interactive sessions provide deep, immersive learning through Learn-Practice-Test (LPT) Pedagogy. In this technology-driven time, Extramarks is constantly promoting independent learning for its stakeholders (parents, teachers & students) while maintaining continuity from school to home and ensuring effective communication among the stakeholders. However, over the years, their application was running on standalone servers in the public domain to handle the incoming load. This made them dependent on the central server and possessed many security issues, undoubtedly making the application vulnerable to attacks and malware. The client was looking to cater to three prime requirements: A solution that would automate their scaling. Secure its application from any kind of attacks and, Deploy their application at a faster pace. The Solution The Cloud Consultants at Rapyder designed the right solution and configuration that could support the seamless functioning of the application to overcome the challenges mentioned above. The consultants at Rapyder proposed the following solutions to achieve the desired results: The servers were migrated to private subnets to make the application secure. AWS WAF was implemented with CloudFront to tackle the vulnerabilities of the website. AWS Auto Scaling was implemented to handle the load based on the incoming load on the servers. OWASP WAF rules such as Cross Site Match Conditions, Size constraint conditions, SQL injection, IP Match Conditions, and String regex Match Conditions were implemented to prevent further vulnerabilities. For new deployments to the server running in Auto Scaling groups, a script was written that the client would deploy the application on one static server and then run the custom script by Rapyder. The script was designed to take the AMI of the server and deploy it on Auto Scaling Group, ensuring that the new application was running successfully. The Benefits With Rapyder’s consultation and the right solution, Extramarks achieved the desired results and scalability on their application. Here’s a lowdown of the benefits derived by them: Servers now on private subnets were no longer publicly accessible and restricted any unauthorized access, making the server secure. The client no longer needed to perform Manual Scaling. With the implementation of AWS Auto Scaling, Extramarks achieved an ROI of up to 15% on AWS cost. Our scheduled scaling at peak times made them witness further savings of 10%. CloudFront by AWS helped the client cache the content dynamically and made them leverage edge location for faster content delivery.

SquarePanda is an award-winning, edtech literacy platform and research-based phonics learning system for pre-readers and early readers worldwide. Equipped with this AI-based platform that assesses and engages learners, SquarePanda aims to empower all children to reach their full potential. Square Panda’s adaptive platform helps children globally, across skill sets and socio-economic backgrounds, to equip themselves with reading, writing, and communicative skills. The learning experience is joyful and based on innovative teaching practices. The Business Need The applications were already hosted on AWS in the US. However, with the new setup in India, SquarePanda wanted to expand its operations in India and China and implement the hosting of applications on AWS in these new geographical locations. The client wanted to address the business need for a faster go-to-market facility and deliver an enhanced customer experience that would be brought about with this implementation. It was looking for a partner who could provide them with an AWS solution for their application and ensure scalability, high availability, and security. Rapyder Cloud Solutions, an Advanced AWS Consulting partner with extensive experience and competency in successful cloud migration and implementation services, was chosen and partnered with. This led to the Customer looking for a solution that would improve its delivery and support of IT while lowering the total cost of ownership. The Solution To effectively address the business need of the Client, Rapyder’s team of Cloud Architects thoroughly studied the former’s requirement for implementation. A customized solution around AWS services was implemented while applying Cloud Deployment Architecture best practices and business continuity principles. Rapyder implemented the following proposed solution and architecture approach: In the new AWS infrastructure, all the servers were launched in private subnets for ease of administration and control, with most components deployed in multi-AZ configuration to avoid single-point failure. AWS-managed load balancer was used to balance the traffic across two availability zones. The balancer was configured to route all site traffic, including dynamic pages. AWS-managed NAT Gateway was used for any outbound traffic from servers in private subnets. Monitoring and alerts were set up on each server to monitor metrics like CPU, memory, and disk. Cloudtrail was enabled for all regions. CI/CD pipelines were set up for each application component, where AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy were used. The Benefits Time-to-market was significantly reduced by 30%, with high agility achieved. The new infrastructure was up and running in two weeks. No single point of failure was witnessed as the environment was running in high availability behind the load balancer.

The company offers retailers and brands a disruptive cloud solution enabling customers to find and order products and services online. The solution provides retailers with innovative store management and contextual visibility to improve profitability. It also connects stores with their consumers, facilitating the last-mile connection. The solution comprises a tablet, barcode scanner, thermal printer, and an intelligent external 22” consumer-facing LED display for visual consumer engagement. The Business Need According to Nielsen, India has over 6.65 million Kirana stores, contributing to nearly 90% of its total trade. The global pandemic has reinforced the importance of local Kirana stores and changed how these Kirana stores function. With the surge in demand, various demand and supply-related challenges have emerged. Social distancing and hygiene norms have made e-payment the new normal. Research suggests that the customers these stores won during the pandemic can only be retained if they offer home delivery, credit, hyper-local apps, and hyper-local merchandising services. SnapBizz has been working to organize and digitize these Kirana stores to improve their profitability. However, the need to digitize everything from stocks to payments has led to an unexpected surge in traffic, affecting the solution’s performance. The client wanted a solution that would address the following needs: Focus on business innovation, Automate scaling of the application to handle traffic, Lower their infrastructure cost, Improve application performance. The Solution The Cloud Consultants at Rapyder designed a scalable architecture on AWS to address the over-provisioning of resources. The solution had the following features: Considered AWS Mumbai to host applications since the user base in India. Hosted all servers behind the load balancer in private subnets across different availability zones (AZ) to reduce latency. Terminated all incoming traffic on the application load balancer and routed them to appropriate servers in the backend to ensure a single-entry point and avoid internet exposure. Deployed app servers in autoscaling groups for scalability and high availability. Applied AWS Certificate Manager on load balancers to securely manage SSL certificates. Used load balancers to offload SSL certificates and send traffic to the appropriate instance. Used RDS MySQL in multi-AZ to ensure high availability of the global database. Used MS SQL standard on EC2 for reporting purposes. Migrated from Azure CosmosDB to Amazon DynamoDB. Used AWS Data Pipeline to replicate data from DynamoDB to SQL Server. Used AWS ElastiCache for Redis caching.

case_study,Rapyder Builds Infrastructure As Code Using Terraform,"Rapyder Builds Infrastructure As Code Using Terraform Team Rapyder September 15, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> Rapyder Builds Infrastructure As Code Using Terraform About The Company The client started the business as a consultancy helping large companies run competitions in schools. It soon became evident, however, that data was the key to all things marketing. Incorporated as a Limited company in 1991, the company has been using data to help education suppliers market and sell effectively to schools and colleges. The Challenge The client sought a cloud-agnostic tool to orchestrate the infrastructure onto multiple public clouds (AWS, Azure). They wanted the infrastructure to be up in a few minutes. The client had different environments like production, staging, and QA to test. Database backups were also included as part of the infrastructure setup. The Solution DevOps engineers at Rapyder Cloud Solutions reviewed and analyzed the client’s requirement where the need was to orchestrate the infrastructure within a few minutes, and that also should be cloud agnostic. Engineers at Rapyder used Terraform to codify the provisioning of infrastructure onto the public cloud and enabled this provisioning to these clouds through automation. By automating manual configurations, we also eliminated the possibility of human error. The solution provided by Rapyder also took care of the database backup for the situation when the infrastructure is destroyed – automated backup of the database would be kicked off in that scenario. Not only infra but Rapyder also automated the application deployment process by integrating GitLab (an open source software) to improve software development and accelerate the software delivery. As a result, the client’s application could be brought up within no time and without human intervention. The client can now test their application and deploy it in the production environment without downtime using this solution. The client‘s time to market is significantly reduced. The solution allows the client to orchestrate the infra as and when needed. The Benefits The client can launch the infrastructure over multiple public clouds within a brief time (a matter of minutes). The client has the flexibility to launch the infrastructure as and when needed. The automated deployments help the client push the application into production seamlessly, reducing the market time. Automated database backup ensures they always have a copy of their latest database that can be used in DR.

case_study,AWS Managed Cloud Service Case Study: Travel Firm Achieved Cost Saving,"AWS Managed Cloud Service Case Study: Travel Firm Achieved Cost Saving Team Rapyder August 29, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> AWS Managed Cloud Service Case Study: Travel Firm Achieved Cost Saving About The Client Our Customer is a leader in the travel industry assisting its customers in making intelligent travel plans as a one-stop shopping place for all their travel needs. From a small travel agency more than 5 decades ago, they have expanded exponentially, becoming one of the largest travel companies in India with multiple offices worldwide. The Challenge Our Customer, already on AWS Cloud, was in an expansion phase. During peak hours and heavy workloads, their applications stopped responding to user requests leading to frequent service outages resulting in a potential revenue loss for the organization. With the internal teams not well versed with the Cloud technologies, the architecture was inefficient due to best practices not being followed, and there were limitations in dealing with simultaneous failures or traffic congestions. Also, performance optimization was tedious because there was no monitoring enabled for their PaaS service. The Solution After taking over the Managed Services, the AWS-certified engineers at Rapyder introduced several processes and procedures to assist in alleviating the Customer’s pain points: 24x7x365 Failure Response Process: Continuously monitoring, Online ticketing service, and alarms were handled directly by iNOC engineers, ultimately leading to fast response time. The monitoring system was set up on the cloud, based on the customer’s existing environment and demand to continuously monitor all applications in real-time, improving decision-making. Efficient architecture design: Re-Architected different application components to make them scalable and introduced Auto-heal concepts at AWS Cloud & client services level. Auto-scaling of app components was implemented. Centralized logging & Alerting system was put in place to identify application issues. The access mechanism was rectified to improve the security of the deployment process. Operational processes were streamlined for smoother operations on data access. Automation on build deployment was put in place. Implement a security framework to enable the development team to focus on the business prospectus and not on operational hazards. Creation of a fail-safe cloud operating environment by implementing scheduled backups and automatic restores in case of data loss. Audit trails are maintained for every activity performed on the infrastructure for operational transparency. The Benefits Since moving under the Rapyder Managed Services portfolio, the Customer’s average disruption time, which previously was 10 days in a Business year (approx. 97% SLA), was reduced to 52 minutes (approx. 99.99% SLA) in a Business year, thus making 99.99% of service availability a reality. The Customer could reliably operate their frequently growing workloads without system downtime or issues. Our Client reduced its monthly AWS infrastructure operating costs by 12%, consolidating idle resources and introducing AWS RI Model.

case_study,AWS DevOps Services Case Study – Implemented a CI/CD Pipeline on Tix,"AWS DevOps Services Case Study – Implemented a CI/CD Pipeline on Tix Team Rapyder August 29, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> AWS DevOps Services Case Study – Implemented a CI/CD Pipeline on Tix About The Client Tix is a ticket booking application based in Australia with a single goal of making live events more affordable & accessible. They take out the pain of searching different sources to find tickets and put them all in the palm of your hand with the TIX app. The application operates in 6 cities across 5 countries with over 1.60 million members & app users. The Challenge In this competitive era, every business aims to provide its customers with the best product and service in no time. TIX aims to create one platform where live entertainment can be affordable and more accessible. For this, the client was developing a B2C online booking application to be hosted on AWS cloud and had two prime requirements: They were looking for AWS expertise that would provide solutions on AWS and help them implement the entire Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with no manual intervention and auto rollbacks in the case of deployment failures with AWS services. A highly scalable and reliable architecture for their application. A CapEx-based solution instead of an OpEx for the application to change the application’s architecture later if needed. The Solution They were looking for AWS experts that would help them provide solutions for shortening their development cycle with reduced deployments and auto rollbacks. The client had 3 different environments, Dev, SIT, and Production Environment. For each pipeline, unique AWS CodePipelines were implemented for automated deployments. WebHooks were configured for each pipeline so that the pipelines would get triggered with every commit. AWS Parameter Store was used to store & secure the configuration data, which will be replaced at the time of deployment based on the environment. Jenkins was configured for MS builds which will push the binaries to AWS S3 to manage, organize and secure the data. A package manager server was also set up from where the application can download the Node and NuGet packages, not making it available to the public internet for downloading the packages. This, in return, reduced the build time. Code Deploy was used to deploy the artifact to the target servers to avoid downtime during the deployment. Notifications were set up at the pipeline level to notify clients about new deployments and failures. Rollbacks were configured; the previous stable version will be deployed in case of a failed deployment. CloudFormation scripts were written for infrastructure to replicate the architecture in a short period. AWS Architecture The Benefits The entire process for all the 3 environments was successfully implemented in the time frame of 1.5 months with full automation. After implementing the solutions provided by Rapyder, TIX witnessed sustainable results for their application development. Here’s a low down of benefits derived: With the help of CloudFormation, the developers could replicate the whole architecture and launch it in no time. A fully automated CI/CD solution eradicated the risk of manual-prone error entirely and fastened the development cycle. 30% of developers’ time is now invested in coding instead of manual deployments and resolving bugs. Manual implementation for a CI/CD solution would have taken around an hour, and de-bugging an error would take the whole day. But with a fully automated CI/CD solution, the process was completed in 10 minutes. The CloudFormation script (Infrastructure as Code) made the development and deployment process efficient, enabling faster go-to-market features.

case_study,BPO Firm Builds a Secure Remote Working Environment Using Amazon Workspaces,"BPO Firm Builds a Secure Remote Working Environment Using Amazon Workspaces Team Rapyder August 17, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> BPO Firm Builds a Secure Remote Working Environment Using Amazon Workspaces About The Client Our Customer is a pan-India enterprise providing best in class business processing solutions. They have personnel working in three shifts in a day to cater to their customers across the globe. The Business Need The users, when connecting from outside office, faced problems with access to their business applications – both performance slowness and access downtimes. The data also needed to be protected which was a critical thing with respect to DLP. The frequent bad user experience also led to a low towards IT. One prime area of concern was to ensure the security of their data, which had some increased risks when all users were field based. This led to the Customer looking for a solution that would improve its delivery and support of IT while lowering the total cost of ownership. The Solution Solution Architects at Rapyder carried out an assessment of the Customer’s environment & requirements and recommended that they move to a managed workspace environment. All users provisioned on AWS Workspace in the Singapore region. Hardened operating system environments were used as a secure base to package the applications. Identity and access management was established using identity federation back to the corporate Active Directory. Multiple security features included – WAF, USB lockdown, IP lockdown, copy & paste locked down. A VPN tunnel was established between AWS and their data center to allow their access to their enterprise applications. A highly resilient Amazon Workspaces platform was created, ensuring all services are placed across two different availability zones so that in the event of an AZ failure, the services automatically restart and will be available in an alternate zone. The Benefits Better management of infra-structure for optimal resource utilization and application performance. Users can work from anywhere and the company’s data stays on company systems. The new user setup is 75% faster than the old environment, and users are provisioned in as little as 30 minutes. Improved cost efficiency by systematically managing new hires, terminations, and changes, efficiently and effectively. IT support staff focusing less on maintaining IT systems and more on solving business problems.

case_study,AWS Disaster Recovery Helps NBFC Client Reduce Recovery Time & Costs,"AWS Disaster Recovery Helps NBFC Client Reduce Recovery Time & Costs Team Rapyder July 5, 2019 Home >> Insights >> Case Studies >> AWS Disaster Recovery Helps NBFC Client Reduce Recovery Time & Costs About The Client Our client is an NBFC registered with RBI that started commercial operations in 2013. Traditional underwriting methods in India exclude more than 50% of creditworthy SMEs. With a mission to bring a social impact in this segment, they cater primarily to this underserved market by adopting an innovative approach to validate the business’s creditworthiness and identify and serve these credit-worthy merchants. They have launched commercial operations in multiple cities across India with plans for more growth. The Challenge The customer was running multiple business-critical applications on AWS. The applications were not horizontally scalable and running in a single Availability Zone. To mitigate the risk of single-point failure, the customer reached out to Rapyder for a solution. Then, executing a Disaster Recovery strategy ensuring Business Continuity with a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) / Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of close to 30 mins. The Solution Rapyder did a complete study of the Disaster Recovery requirements of the customer. We evaluated different strategies of Active-Passive and Active-Active Disaster Recovery (DR) models. A TCO analysis was done by running an Active-Active setup, and it was found to be more expensive than the customer had budgeted. Rapyder then used a solution provided by one of AWS ISV partners to use block-level replication to replicate the data and server from the production AWS account to a separate DR AWS account. All configurations were made so the servers could be brought up within 15 mins, which exceeded the customer’s expectations. We continue to support our clients in conducting mock drills periodically. The Benefit The customer was delighted with the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) solution and implementation of the project by Rapyder. The Disaster Recovery drills were conducted, and the Recovery Time Objective was found to be less than 15 mins.
